[[File:Devonport Dockyard.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] and the Hamoaze from the [[Rame Peninsula]], [[Cornwall]]]]
The '''Hamoaze''' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|m|ˈ|oʊ|z}}; {{IPA-kw|ˈhɒmøz|[[Cornish language|Cornish]] pronunciation:}}) is an [[estuary|estuarine]] stretch of the tidal [[River Tamar]], between its confluence with the [[River Lynher]] and [[Plymouth Sound]], England.

The name first appears as ''ryver of Hamose'' in 1588 and it originally most likely applied just to a creek of the estuary that led up to the manor of Ham, north of the present-day [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]]. The name evidently later came to be used for the estuary's main channel. The ''ose'' element possibly derives from [[Old English]] ''wāse'' meaning 'mud' (as in 'ooze') – the creek consisting of mud-banks at low tide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The Hamoaze flows past Devonport Dockyard, which is one of three major bases of the [[Royal Navy]] today. The presence of large numbers of small [[watercraft]] are a challenge and hazard to the [[warship]]s using the naval base and dockyard. Navigation on the waterway is controlled by the [[Queen's Harbour Master]] for Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.uk/government/groups/qhm-plymouth Queen's Harbour Master Plymouth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2029/made The Dockyard Port of Plymouth Order 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlements on the banks of the Hamoaze are [[Saltash]], [[Wilcove]], [[Torpoint]] and [[Cremyll]] in [[Cornwall]], as well as [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]] and [[Plymouth]] in [[Devon]].

Two regular ferry services crossing the Hamoaze exist: the [[Torpoint Ferry]] (a [[chain ferry]] that takes vehicles) and the [[Cremyll Ferry]] (passengers and cyclists only).

'''Hanover''' or '''Hannover''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|oʊ-|v|ər}}; {{lang-de|Hannover}}, {{IPA-de|haˈnoːfɐ|pron|De-Hannover.ogg}}), on the River [[Leine]], is the capital and largest city of the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] (''Niedersachsen''), and was once by [[personal union]] the family seat of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], under their title as the dukes of [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (later described as the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Luneburg|Elector of Hanover]]). At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Electorate was enlarged to become a [[Kingdom of Hanover | Kingdom]] with Hanover as its capital.

From 1868 to 1946 Hanover was the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]] and afterwards of the [[Hanover (region)|Hanover administrative region]] until that was abolished in 2005. It is now the capital of the ''Land'' of [[Lower Saxony]]. Since 2001 it has been part of the [[Hanover (district)|Hanover district]] (''Region Hannover''), which is a municipal body made up of the former [[Districts of Germany|district]] (''Landkreis Hannover'') and city of Hanover (note: although both ''Region'' and ''Landkreis'' are translated as ''district'' they are not the same).

With a population of 518,000, Hanover is a major centre of [[Northern Germany]] and the country's [[List of cities in Germany by population|thirteenth largest city]]. Hanover hosts annual commercial [[World's fair|trade fairs]] such as the [[Hanover Fair]] and the [[CeBIT]]. Every year Hanover hosts the [[Schützenfest Hannover]], the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the [[Oktoberfest celebrations#Hannover|Oktoberfest Hannover]], the second largest festival of its kind in [[Germany]]. In 2000, Hanover hosted the world fair [[Expo 2000]]. The [[Hanover fairground]], due to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover is of national importance because of its universities and medical school, its international airport and its large [[Hanover Zoo|zoo]]. The city is also a major crossing point of railway lines and highways ([[Autobahn]]en), connecting European main lines in both the east-west ([[Berlin]]–[[Ruhr|Ruhr area]]) and north-south ([[Hamburg]]–[[Munich]], etc.) directions.

&quot;Hanover&quot; is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopaedias prefer the German spelling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Encyclopædia Britannica] uses &quot;Hannover&quot;. It says &quot;''English'' Hanover&quot; but uses &quot;Hannover&quot; in the prose.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Microsoft Encarta] gives the primary spelling as &quot;Hannover&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hannover.de/english/ |title=Official Website of the City and Region of Hannover |publisher=Hannover.de |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|oʊ-|v|ər}}, with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the first syllable and a [[Stress and vowel reduction in English|reduced]] second syllable, is applied to both the [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] spellings, which is different from German pronunciation {{IPA-de|haˈnoːfɐ|}}, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British [[House of Hanover]].

==History==
[[File:Merian Hannover Ostseite.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Hanover by [[Matthäus Merian]], 1654]]
{{see also|Timeline of Hanover|History of Hanover (region)}}
Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River [[Leine]]. Its original name ''Honovere'' may mean &quot;high (river)bank&quot;, though this is debated (cf. ''das Hohe Ufer''). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the [[Hanseatic League]] city of [[Bremen]] by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide [[North German Plain]] and north-west of the [[Harz]] mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the [[Rhine]], [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the [[Low Countries]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] or [[Thuringia]].

In the 14th century the main [[Church (building)|churches]] of Hanover were built, as well as a [[Defensive wall|city wall]] with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern [[Harz Mountains]], which increased the city's importance.

In 1636 [[George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], ruler of the [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] [[principality of Calenberg]], moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] to the rank of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], colloquially known as the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]] after Calenberg's capital (see also: [[House of Hanover]]). Its electors would later become monarchs of [[Great Britain]] (and from 1801, of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]). The first of these was [[George I of Great Britain|George I Louis]], who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. [[Semi-Salic law]], which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also [[prince-elector|Electoral Princes]] of Hanover.

During the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714–1837), the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact, during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760–1837), there was only one short visit, by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 [[Viceroy]] [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|Adolphus]] represented the monarch in Hanover.

During the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The [[France|French]] army defeated the [[Hanoverian Army of Observation]], leading to the city's occupation as part of the [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|Invasion of Hanover]]. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick|Ferdinand of Brunswick]] the following year.

===19th century===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Hannover Georgstraße mit Theater (um 1895).jpg|thumb|Am [[Kröpcke]], 1895]]
[[File:Hannover Schloss zu Herrenhausen (um 1895).jpg|thumb|right|Schloss [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen]], 1895]]
After [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] imposed the [[Convention of Artlenburg]] (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to [[Great Britain]], where the [[King's German Legion]] was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and [[Black Brunswickers|Brunswick]] that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 elevated the electorate to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the [[Leine]] and since then has grown considerably.

In 1837, the [[personal union]] of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV's]] heir in the United Kingdom was female ([[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]], and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian war]]. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]], Prussia employed [[Prussian Army#Moltke the Elder|Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle]] to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]]. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.

To Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with [[Prussia]] meant an improvement in business. The introduction of [[free trade]] promoted economic growth, and led to the recovery of the [[Gründerzeit]] (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1842 the first [[Horsecar|horse railway]] was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric [[tram]] was installed. In 1887 Hanover's [[Emile Berliner]] invented the record and the [[phonograph|gramophone]].

===Nazi Germany===
After 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] (Nazi party). A large [[German Jews|Jewish population]] then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to [[Poland]], including the [[Herschel Grynszpan|Grynszpan family]]. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son [[Herschel Grynszpan]] was in [[Paris]] at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard [[Ernst vom Rath]], who died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=book-on-grynszpan&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwab|first=Gerald|title=The Day the Holocaust Began: The Odyssey of Herschel Grynszpan|year=1990|publisher=Praeger|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as [[Kristallnacht]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kristal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005201 | title=Kristallnacht: A Nationwide Pogrom, November 9–10, 1938 | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | work=Holocaust Encyclopedia | accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Hanover on 9 November 1938 that the [[synagogue]], designed in 1870 by [[Edwin Oppler]] in [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] style, was burnt by the Nazis.

In September 1941, through the &quot;Action Lauterbacher&quot; plan, a [[ghetto]]isation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the [[Wannsee Conference]], on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsch-jüdische Geschichte der Neuzeit. Band IV |publisher=C.H. Beck |author=Meyer, Michael |year=2000 |location=Munich |isbn=3-406-39705-0 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven [[concentration camps]] were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Konzentrationslager in Hannover - KZ-Arbeit und Rüstungsindustrie in der Spätphase des Zweiten Weltkriegs |publisher=August Lax |author=Fröbe, Rainer |year=1989 |location=Hildesheim |isbn=3-7848-2422-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the [[United States Army]] arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. 
After the war a large group of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] survivors of the nearby [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] settled in Hanover.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexikon&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title='Stadtlexikon Hannover: Von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart' |publisher=Schlütersche |author=Mlynek, Klaus |year=2009 |location=Hannover |pages=17 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Bombing of Hanover in World War II}}
As an important railroad and [[Junction (road)|road junction]] and production center, Hanover was a major target for [[strategic bombing during World War II]], including the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil Campaign]]. Targets included the [[VARTA|AFA]] ([[Herrenhausen|Stöcken]]), the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Deurag-Nerag]] refinery ([[Misburg]]), the [[Continental AG|Continental]] plants ([[Vahrenwald]] and [[Linden-Limmer|Limmer]]), the United light metal works (VLW) in [[Ricklingen]] and [[Laatzen]] (today [[Hanover fairground]]), [[Oil Campaign of World War II#References|the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant]], the [[Hanomag]] factory ([[Linden-Limmer|Linden]]) and the tank factory ''M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen'' (Badenstedt). [[Unfree labour|Forced labourers]] were sometimes used from the [[List of subcamps of Neuengamme|Hannover-Misburg subcamp]] of the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]]. Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city center was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/geschichte/geschichte_/Stadt_Hannover/gesch_zah/gesch_za3.html |title=History of Hanover 1866-1945, official web site of the city (German) |publisher=Hannover.de |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the [[:de:Aegidienkirche (Hannover)|Aegidienkirche]] was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial. Allied bombing destroyed 60% of the built up area of the city. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/hamburg/sources/docs/6/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanover was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new [[States of Germany|state (Land)]] of [[Lower Saxony]] in 1946.

Today Hanover is a Vice-President City of [[Mayors for Peace]], an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2020visioncampaign.org |title=Mayors for Peace |publisher=2020visioncampaign.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418083236/http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/ |archivedate=2011-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Gunpei Yokoi]], traveling on a [[Shinkansen|bullet train]], saw a bored businessman playing with an [[LCD]] [[calculator]] by pressing the buttons. Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crigger |first=Lara |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_87/490-Searching-for-Gunpei-Yokoi |title=The Escapist: Searching for Gunpei Yokoi |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date=March 3, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1980, [[Nintendo]] began to release a series of electronic games designed by Yokoi called the [[Game &amp; Watch]] games.&lt;ref name=&quot;game and watch&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Pollack| first = Andrew| title = Gunpei Yokoi, Chief Designer Of Game Boy, Is Dead at 56| publisher =The New York Times| date = October 9, 1997| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/business/gunpei-yokoi-chief-designer-of-game-boy-is-dead-at-56.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FD%2FDeaths%20(Obituaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit-card-sized calculators that had appeared on the market, Yokoi designed the series of LCD-based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;game over&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Sheff| first = David| authorlink = David Sheff| title = Game Over: Press Start to Continue| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0dK2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Game+Over:+Press+Start+to+Continue&amp;dq=Game+Over:+Press+Start+to+Continue| publisher = GamePress| year = 1999| page = 28| isbn = 978-0-9669617-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For later, more complicated Game &amp; Watch games, Yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or &quot;D-pad&quot; for control of on-screen characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Buchanan| first = Levi| title = From Janitor to Superstar Gunpei Yokoi, inventor of the Game Boy, would have been 67 this week.| publisher = IGN| date = September 8, 2008| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/908/908569p1.html| accessdate = December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yokoi also included his directional pad on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] controllers, and the cross-shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/courses/13things/7643.html|title=The Game Controller: From the Beginning|publisher=Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World.

In 1982, the [[Bandai LCD Solarpower]] was the first [[solar energy|solar-powered]] gaming device. Some of its games, such as the [[Survival horror|horror]]-themed game ''Terror House'', features two [[LCD panel]]s, one stacked on the other, for an early [[Stereoscopy|3D effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/361591/the-top-ten-retro-gaming-secrets/3|title=The top ten retro gaming secrets|work=PC Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Takara Tomy]]'s [[Tomytronic 3D]] simulates [[3D computer graphics|3D]] by having two [[LCD]] panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device, making it the first dedicated home video 3D hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/361591/the-top-ten-retro-gaming-secrets|title=The top ten retro gaming secrets|work=PC Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginnings ===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the beginnings of the handheld game console industry as we know it, after the demise of the Microvision. As backlit LCD game consoles with color graphics consume a lot of power, they were not battery-friendly like the non-backlit original Game Boy whose monochrome graphics allowed longer battery life. By this point, [[rechargeable battery]] technology had not yet matured and so the more advanced game consoles of the time such as the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Atari Lynx]] did not have nearly as much success as the Game Boy.

Even though third-party rechargeable batteries were available for the battery-hungry alternatives to the Game Boy, these batteries employed a [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] process and had to be completely discharged before being recharged to ensure maximum efficiency; lead-acid batteries could be used with automobile circuit limiters (cigarette lighter plug devices); but the batteries had mediocre portability. The later [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|NiMH]] batteries, which do not share this requirement for maximum efficiency, were not released until the late 1990s, years after the Game Gear, Atari Lynx, and original Game Boy had been discontinued. During the time when technologically superior handhelds had strict technical limitations, batteries had a very low [[ampere-hour|mAh]] rating since batteries with heavy power density were not yet available.

Modern game systems such as the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] have rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium-Ion]] batteries with proprietary shapes. Other seventh-generation consoles such as the [[GP2X]] use standard [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]]. Because the mAh rating of alkaline batteries has increased since the 1990s, the power needed for handhelds like the GP2X may be supplied by relatively few batteries.

==== Game Boy ====
{{Main article|Game Boy}}

[[File:Game-Boy-Original.jpg|right|thumb|130px|The original Game Boy]]
[[Nintendo]] released the Game Boy on April 21, 1989 (September 1990 for the UK). The design team headed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] had also been responsible for the [[Game &amp; Watch]] system, as well as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Kid Icarus]]''. The Game Boy came under scrutiny by some industry critics, saying that the monochrome screen was too small, and the processing power was inadequate. The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns, and when compared to the Microvision, the Game Boy was a huge leap forward.

Yokoi recognized that the Game Boy needed a [[Killer application|killer app]]—at least one game that would define the console, and persuade customers to buy it. In June 1988, [[Minoru Arakawa]], then-CEO of Nintendo of America saw a demonstration of the game ''[[Tetris]]'' at a trade show. Nintendo purchased the rights for the game, and packaged it with the Game Boy system. It was almost an immediate hit. By the end of the year more than a million units were sold in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBsales1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstarkansasnews.net/2011/01/game-boy-nintendo-dominates-the-portable-market/ |title=Game Boy — Nintendo dominates the portable market |accessdate=April 28, 2011  |date=January 22, 2011 |publisher=First Arkansas News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 31, 2005, the Game Boy and [[Game Boy Color]] combined to sell over 118 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendoannualreport2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/corp/report/NintendoAnnualReport2005.pdf |title=05 Annual Report |accessdate=March 22, 2008  |date=March 31, 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GBsales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/source/7.htm |title=Game Boy |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |work=A Brief History of Game Console Warfare |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509094404/http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/source/7.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Atari Lynx ====
{{Main article|Atari Lynx}}
[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|left|thumb|Atari Lynx]]
In 1987, [[Epyx]] created the Handy Game; a device that would turn into the Atari Lynx in 1989. It is the first color handheld console ever made, as well as the first with a [[backlight|backlit]] screen. It also features networking support with up to 17 other players, and advanced hardware that allows the zooming and scaling of sprites.  The Lynx can also be turned upside down to accommodate [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] players. However, all these features came at a very high price point, which drove consumers to seek cheaper alternatives. The Lynx is also very unwieldy, consumes batteries very quickly, and lacked the third-party support enjoyed by its competitors. Due to its high price, short battery life, production shortages, a dearth of compelling games, and Nintendo's aggressive marketing campaign, and despite a redesign in 1991, the Lynx became a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]]. Despite this, companies like Telegames helped to keep the system alive long past its commercial relevance, and when new owner Hasbro released the rights to develop for the public domain, independent developers like Songbird have managed to release new commercial games for the system every year until 2004's ''Winter Games''.{{clear}}

==== TurboExpress ====
{{Main article|TurboExpress}}
[[File:NEC-TurboExpress-Upright-FL.jpg|thumb|150px|TurboExpress handheld]]
The TurboExpress is a portable version of the TurboGrafx, released in 1990 for $249.99 (the price was briefly raised to $299.99, soon dropped back to $249.99, and by 1992 it was $199.99). Its Japanese equivalent is the [[TurboExpress|PC Engine GT]].

It is the most advanced handheld of its time and can play all the [[TurboGrafx-16]]'s games (which are on a small, credit-card sized media called [[HuCard]]s). It has a 66&amp;nbsp;mm (2.6 in.) screen, the same as the original Game Boy, but in a much higher resolution, and can display 64 [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] at once, 16 per scanline, in 512 colors. Although the hardware can only handle 481 simultaneous colors. It has 8&amp;nbsp;kilobytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. The Turbo runs the HuC6820 [[Central processing unit|CPU]] at 1.79 or 7.16&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]].

The optional &quot;TurboVision&quot; TV tuner includes RCA audio/video input, allowing users to use TurboExpress as a video monitor. The &quot;TurboLink&quot; allowed two-player play. ''Falcon'', a flight simulator, included a &quot;head-to-head&quot; dogfight mode that can only be accessed via TurboLink. However, very few TG-16 games offered co-op play modes especially designed with the TurboExpress in mind.{{clear}}

==== Bitcorp Gamate ====
{{Main article|Gamate}}
[[File:Gamate.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Gamate and game cards]]
The Bitcorp Gamate is the one of the first handheld game systems created in response to the Nintendo Game Boy. It was released in Asia in 1990 and distributed worldwide by 1991.

Like the Sega Game Gear, it was horizontal in orientation and like the Game Boy, required 4 AA batteries. Unlike many later Game Boy clones, its internal components were professionally assembled (no &quot;glop-top&quot; chips). Unfortunately the system's fatal flaw is its screen. Even by the standards of the day, its screen is rather difficult to use, suffering from similar motion blur problems that were common complaints with the first generation Game Boys. Likely because of this fact sales were quite poor, and Bitcorp closed by 1992. However, new games continued to be published for the Asian market, possibly as late as 1994. The total number of games released for the system remains unknown.

Interestingly, Gamate games were designed for stereo sound, but the console is only equipped with a mono speaker. To appreciate the full sound palette, a user must plug into the head phone jack. Doing so reveals very sophisticated music.{{clear}}

==== Game Gear ====
{{Main article|Sega Game Gear}}
[[File:Game-Gear-Handheld.jpg|thumb|Sega Game Gear]]
The Game Gear is the third color handheld console, after the Lynx and the TurboExpress; produced by Sega. Released in Japan in 1990 and in North America and Europe in 1991, it is based on the [[Master System]], which gave Sega the ability to quickly create Game Gear games from its large library of games for the Master System. While never reaching the level of success enjoyed by Nintendo, the Game Gear proved to be a fairly durable competitor, lasting longer than any other Game Boy rivals.

While the Game Gear is most frequently seen in black or navy blue, it was also released in a variety of additional colors: red, light blue, yellow, clear, and violet. All of these variations were released in small quantities and frequently only in the Asian market.

Following Sega's success with the Game Gear, they began development on a successor during the early 1990s, which was intended to feature a [[touchscreen]] interface, many years before the [[Nintendo DS]]. However, such a technology was very expensive at the time, and the handheld itself was estimated to have cost around $289 were it to be released. Sega eventually chose to shelve the idea and instead release the [[Genesis Nomad]], a handheld version of the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], as the successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|publisher=IGN|author=Travis Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Watara Supervision ====
{{Main article|Watara Supervision}}
[[File:Watara-Supervision-Tilted.jpg|thumb|left|The Watara Supervision with tilting screen.]]
The Watara Supervision was released in 1992 in an attempt to compete with the Nintendo Game Boy. The first model was designed very much like a Game Boy, but it is grey in color and has a slightly larger screen. The second model was made with a hinge across the center and can be bent slightly to provide greater comfort for the user. While the system did enjoy a modest degree of success, it never impacted the sales of Nintendo or Sega. The Supervision was redesigned a final time as &quot;The Magnum&quot;. Released in limited quantities it was roughly equivalent to the [[Game Boy Pocket]]. It was available in three colors: yellow, green and grey. Watara designed many of the games themselves, but did receive some third party support, most notably from [[Thin Chen Enterprise|Sachen]].

A TV adapter was available in both PAL and NTSC formats that could transfer the Supervision's black-and-white palette to 4 colors, similar in some regards to the Super Game Boy from Nintendo.{{clear}}

==== Hartung Game Master ====
{{Main article|Hartung Game Master}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hgm front-1-.jpg|right|thumb|Hartung Gamemaster]] --&gt;
The Hartung Game Master is an obscure handheld released at an unknown point in the early 1990s. Its graphics were much lower than most of its contemporaries, similar in complexity to the Atari 2600. It was available in black, white, and purple, and was frequently rebranded by its distributors, such as Delplay, Videojet and Virella.
The exact number of games released is not known, but is likely around 20. The system most frequently turns up in Europe and Australia.{{clear}}

=== Late 1990s ===
By this time, the lack of significant development in [[Nintendo]]'s product line began allowing more advanced systems such as the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] and the [[WonderSwan Color]] to achieve moderate success.{{clear}}

==== Game.com ====
{{Main article|Game.com}}
[[File:Tiger-Game-Com-FL.jpg|thumb|Game.com]]
The Game.com (pronounced in TV commercials as &quot;game com&quot;, not &quot;game dot com&quot;, and not capitalized in marketing material) is a handheld game console released by [[Tiger Electronics]] in September 1997. It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience, sporting PDA-style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus. However, Tiger hoped it would also challenge Nintendo's Game Boy and gain a following among younger gamers too. Unlike other handheld game consoles, the first game.com consoles included two slots for game cartridges, which would not happen again until the Tapwave Zodiac, the DS and DS Lite, and could be connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem. Later models had only a single cartridge slot.{{clear}}

==== Game Boy Color ====
{{Main article|Game Boy Color}}
[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Game Boy Color was the first handheld by Nintendo featuring Colors]]
The Game Boy Color (also referred to as GBC or CGB) is Nintendo's successor to the Game Boy and was released on October 21, 1998, in Japan and in November of the same year in the United States. It features a color screen, and is slightly bigger than the [[Game Boy Pocket]]. The processor is twice as fast as a Game Boy's and has twice as much memory. It also had an [[infrared]] communications port for wireless linking which did not appear in later versions of the Game Boy, such as the Game Boy Advance.

The Game Boy Color was a response to pressure from game developers for a new system, as they felt that the Game Boy, even in its latest incarnation, the Game Boy Pocket, was insufficient. The resulting product was backward compatible, a first for a handheld console system, and leveraged the large library of games and great installed base of the predecessor system. This became a major feature of the Game Boy line, since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors. As of March 31, 2005, the Game Boy and [[Game Boy Color]] combined to sell 118.69 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendoannualreport2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GBsales&quot;/&gt;

The console is capable of displaying up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of 32,768, and can add basic four-color shading to games that had been developed for the original Game Boy. It can also give the sprites and backgrounds separate colors, for a total of more than four colors.{{clear}}

==== Neo Geo Pocket Color ====
{{Main article|Neo Geo Pocket Color}}
[[File:Neo-Geo-Pocket-Color-Blue-Left.jpg|thumb|Neo Geo Pocket Color]]
The Neo Geo Pocket Color (or NGPC) was released in 1999 in Japan, and later that year in the United States and Europe. It is a 16-bit color handheld game console designed by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]], the maker of the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] home console and arcade machine. It came after SNK's original [[Neo Geo Pocket]] monochrome handheld, which debuted in 1998 in Japan.

In 2000 following SNK's purchase by Japanese [[Pachinko]] manufacturer Aruze, the Neo Geo Pocket Color was dropped from both the US and European markets, purportedly due to commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgamer.net/articles/neo-geo-pocket-color-the-portable-that-changed-everything&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

The system seemed well on its way to being a success in the U.S. It was more successful than any Game Boy competitor since [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], but was hurt by several factors, such as SNK's infamous lack of communication with third-party developers, and anticipation of the Game Boy Advance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The decision to ship U.S. games in cardboard boxes in a cost-cutting move rather than hard plastic cases that Japanese and European releases were shipped in may have also hurt US sales.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}{{clear}}

==== Wonderswan Color ====
{{Main article|Wonderswan Color}}
[[File:WonderSwan-Color-Blue-Left.jpg|left|thumb|The Wonderswan Color]]
The WonderSwan Color is a handheld game console designed by [[Bandai]]. It was released on December 9, 2000, in Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;swanLaunch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promoduck.com/PressRelease/html/press_con10a048.htm |title=Bandai announces release of WonderSwan color |accessdate=April 28, 2011  |date=August 30, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was a moderate success.

The original [[WonderSwan]] had only a black and white screen. Although the WonderSwan Color was slightly larger and heavier (7&amp;nbsp;mm and 2&amp;nbsp;g) compared to the original WonderSwan, the color version featured 512&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]&lt;ref name=&quot;swanSpec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/084/084272p1.html |title=WonderSwan Color Revealed |accessdate=April 28, 2011  |date=August 30, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and a larger color LCD screen. In addition, the WonderSwan Color is compatible with the original WonderSwan library of games.

Prior to WonderSwan's release, Nintendo had virtually a monopoly in the Japanese video game handheld market. After the release of the WonderSwan Color, Bandai took approximately 8% of the market share in Japan partly due to its low price of 6800 yen (approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]65).&lt;ref name=&quot;swanSpec&quot; /&gt;

Another reason for the WonderSwan's success in Japan was the fact that Bandai managed to get a deal with [[Square (company)|Square]] to port over the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games with improved graphics and controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;swanSpec&quot; /&gt; However, with the popularity of the Game Boy Advance and the reconciliation between Square and Nintendo, the WonderSwan Color and its successor, the [[SwanCrystal]] quickly lost its [[competitive advantage]].{{clear}}

=== Early 2000s ===
The 2000s saw a major leap in innovation, particularly in the second half with the release of the DS and [[PSP]].

==== Game Boy Advance ====
{{Main article|Game Boy Advance}}
[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|right|thumb|The Game Boy Advance was a major upgrade to the Game Boy line]]
In 2001, Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance (GBA or AGB), which added two shoulder buttons, a larger screen, and more computing power than the Game Boy Color.

The design was revised two years later when the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] (GBA SP), a more compact version, was released. The SP features a &quot;[[Bivalve shell|clamshell]]&quot; design (folding open and closed, like a laptop computer), as well as a [[Frontlight|frontlit]] color display and rechargeable battery. Despite the smaller form factor, the screen remained the same size as that of the original. In 2005, the [[Game Boy Micro]] was released. This revision sacrifices screen size and backwards compatibility with previous Game Boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter [[Backlight|backlit]] screen. A new SP model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time.

Along with the [[Nintendo GameCube]], the GBA also introduced the concept of &quot;connectivity&quot;: using a handheld system as a console controller. A handful of games use this feature, most notably ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Pac-Man Vs.]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]''.

As of December 31, 2007, the GBA, GBA SP, and the Game Boy Micro combined have sold 80.72 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;080124e&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2008/080124e.pdf#page=8 |title=Consolidated Financial Highlights |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |format=PDF | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Game Park 32 ====
{{Main article|GP32}}
[[File:Gp32-flu.jpg|left|thumb|GP32]]
The original GP32 was released in 2001 by the South Korean company [[Game Park]] a few months after the launch of the Game Boy Advance. It featured a 32-bit CPU, 133&amp;nbsp;MHz processor, MP3 and Divx player, and e-book reader. [[SmartMedia]] cards were used for storage, and could hold up to 128mb of anything downloaded through a USB cable from a PC. The GP32 was redesigned in 2003. A front-lit screen was added and the new version was called GP32 FLU (Front Light Unit). In summer 2004, another redesign, the GP32 BLU, was made, and added a backlit screen. This version of the handheld was planned for release outside South Korea; in Europe, and it was released for example in Spain (VirginPlay was the distributor). While not a commercial success on a level with mainstream handhelds (only 30,000 units were sold), it ended up being used mainly as a platform for user-made applications and emulators of other systems, being popular with developers and more technically adept users.&lt;ref name=&quot;clockerz&quot;&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6159783.html GP2X Q&amp;A, With Craig Rothwell].

[[File:Nokia-NGage-LL.jpg|right|thumb|150px|N-Gage]]
[[File:Nokia-NGage-QD.jpg|left|thumb|150px|N-Gage QD]]
[[Nokia]] released the N-Gage in 2003. It was designed as a combination MP3 player, cellphone, PDA, radio, and gaming device. The system received much criticism alleging defects in its physical design and layout, including its vertically oriented screen and requirement of removing the battery to change game cartridges. The most well known of these was &quot;[[N-Gage (device)|sidetalking]]&quot;, or the act of placing the phone speaker and receiver on an edge of the device instead of one of the flat sides, causing the user to appear as if they are speaking into a [[taco]].

The N-Gage QD was later released to address the design flaws of the original. However, certain features available in the original N-Gage, including MP3 playback, FM radio reception, and USB connectivity were removed.

[[N-Gage (service)|Second generation of N-Gage]] launched on April 3, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015450/http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archivedate=April 12, 2009 |title= A New Day for N-Gage |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a service for selected [[Nokia]] [[Smartphone]]s.{{clear}}

==== Cybiko ====
{{Main article|Cybiko}}
[[File:cybiko.jpg|right|thumb|Cybiko Classic with extended antenna on the main desktop.]]

The [[Cybiko]] is a Russian hand-held computer introduced in May 2000 by David Yang's company and designed for teenage audiences, featuring its own two-way radio text messaging system. It has over 430 &quot;official&quot; freeware games and applications. Because of the text messaging system, it features a QWERTY keyboard that was used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on was made for the unit as well as a SmartMedia card reader. The company stopped manufacturing the units after two product versions and only a few years on the market. Cybikos can communicate with each other up to a maximum range of 300 metres (0.19 miles). Several Cybikos can chat with each other in a wireless chatroom.

Cybiko Classic:

There were two models of the Classic Cybiko. Visually, the only difference was that the original version had a power switch on the side, whilst the updated version used the &quot;escape&quot; key for power management. Internally, the differences between the two models were in the internal memory, and the location of the firmware.

Cybiko Xtreme:

The Cybiko Xtreme was the second-generation Cybiko handheld. It featured various improvements over the original Cybiko, such as a faster processor, more RAM, more ROM, a new operating system, a new keyboard layout and case design, greater wireless range, a microphone, improved audio output, and smaller size.

==== Tapwave Zodiac ====
{{Main article|Tapwave Zodiac}}
In 2003, Tapwave released the Zodiac. It was designed to be a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-handheld game console hybrid. It supported photos, movies, music, [[Internet]], and documents. The Zodiac used a special version Palm OS 5, 5.2T, that supported the special gaming buttons and graphics chip. Two versions were available, Zodiac 1 and 2, differing in memory and looks. The Zodiac line ended in July 2005 when Tapwave declared bankruptcy.{{clear}}

=== Mid 2000s ===

==== Nintendo DS ====
{{Main article|Nintendo DS}}
[[File:Nintendo-DS-Fat-Blue.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo DS has two screens (the lower of which is a touchscreen), a microphone and Wi-Fi connectivity.]]
The Nintendo DS was released in November 2004. Among its new features were the incorporation of two screens, a [[touchscreen]], wireless connectivity, and a microphone port. As with the Game Boy Advance SP, the DS features a clamshell design, with the two screens aligned vertically on either side of the hinge.

The DS's lower screen is touch sensitive, designed to be pressed with a stylus, a user's finger or a special &quot;thumb pad&quot; (a small plastic pad attached to the console's wrist strap, which can be affixed to the thumb to simulate an analog stick). More traditional controls include four face buttons, two shoulder buttons, a [[D-pad]], and &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Select&quot; buttons. The console also features online capabilities via the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] and ad-hoc wireless networking for multiplayer games with up to sixteen players. It is backwards-compatible with all Game Boy Advance games, but not games designed for the Game Boy or Game Boy Color.

In January 2006, Nintendo revealed an updated version of the DS: the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] (released on March 2, 2006, in Japan) with an updated, smaller form factor (42% smaller and 21% lighter than the original Nintendo DS), a cleaner design, longer battery life, and brighter, higher-quality displays, with adjustable brightness. It is also able to connect wirelessly with Nintendo's Wii console.

In October 2008, Nintendo announced the [[Nintendo DSi]], with larger, 3.25-inch screens and two integrated cameras. It has an [[Secure Digital|SD card]] storage slot in place of the [[Game Boy Advance]] slot, plus internal flash memory for storing downloaded games. It was released on November 1, 2008, in Japan, and was released in North America April 5, 2009, and April 3, 2009, in Europe.

As of December 31, 2009, the Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite and Nintendo DSi combined have sold 125.13 million units worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/090507e.pdf#page=22 |title=Consolidated Financial Highlights |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |date=May 7, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=Nintendo |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Nintendo released a larger version of the DSi, called the DSi XL.{{clear}}

==== Game King ====
{{Main article|Game King}}
[[File:GameKing2.jpg|left|thumb|The GameKing 2.]]
The GameKing is a handheld game console released by the Chinese company TimeTop in 2004. The first model while original in design owes a large debt to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. The second model, the GameKing 2, is believed to be inspired by Sony's PSP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/101781/gameking-2-portable-game-machine Gameking 2 Portable Game Machine]. Gizmodo.com (April 30, 2005). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This model also was upgraded with a backlit screen, with a distracting background transparency (which can be removed by opening up the console). A color model, the GameKing 3 apparently exists, but was only made for a brief time and was difficult to purchase outside of Asia.  Whether intentionally or not, the GameKing has the most primitive graphics of any handheld released since the Game Boy of 1989. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As many of the games have an &quot;old school&quot; simplicity, the device has developed a small cult following. The Gameking's speaker is quite loud and the cartridges' sophisticated looping soundtracks (sampled from other sources) are seemingly at odds with its primitive graphics.

TimeTop made at least one additional device sometimes labeled as &quot;GameKing&quot;, but while it seems to possess more advanced graphics, is essentially an emulator that plays a handful of multi-carts (like the GB Station Light II). Outside of Asia (especially China) however the Gameking remains relatively unheard of due to the enduring popularity of Japanese handhelds such as those manufactured by Nintendo and Sony.{{clear}}

Sony later said that only the European and Japanese versions were being cut, and that the console would still be available in the US.
Unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive, but instead has 16 GB of internal flash memory to store games, video, pictures, and other media. This can be extended by up to 32 GB with the use of a Memory Stick Micro (M2) flash card. Also unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. It has a 3.8&quot; 480 × 272 LCD (compared to the larger 4.3&quot; 480 × 272 pixel LCD on previous PSP models). The screen slides up to reveal the main controls.

However, PSone Classics and PS2 titles were not compatible at the time of the primary public release in Japan. The Vita's dual analog sticks will be supported on selected PSP games. The graphics for PSP releases will be up-scaled, with a smoothing filter to reduce pixelation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heinrich Abeken''' (August 19, 1809{{snd}}August 8, 1872) was a German theologian and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n Privy Legation Councillor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.

Abeken was born and raised in the city of [[Osnabrück]] as a son of a merchant, he was incited to a higher education by the example of his uncle [[Bernhard Rudolf Abeken]]. After finishing the college in Osnabrück, he moved in 1827 to visit the University of Berlin to study theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He soon combined philosophical and philological studies and was interested in art and modern literature.

In 1831, Abeken acquired a [[licenciate]] of theology. At the end of the year he visited Rome, and was welcomed in the house of [[Christian Karl Josias, Freiherr von Bunsen]]. Abeken participated in Bunsen's works, namely an evangelic prayer and hymn-book. In 1834 became chaplain to the Prussian embassy in Rome.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abeken, Heinrich|volume=1|pages=38-39}} Endnote: See ''Heinrich Abeken, ein schlichtes Leben in bewegter Zeit'' (Berlin, 1898), by his widow. This is valuable by reason of the letters written from the Prussian headquarters.&lt;/ref&gt; He married his first wife, who died soon thereafter.
Bunsen left Rome in 1838 and Abeken followed soon thereafter to Germany. In 1841, he was sent to England to help founding a German-English evangelic [[episcopacy]] in [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In the same year, he was sent by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] to [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]], where he joined an expedition led by professor [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]. In 1845 and 1846 he returned via Jerusalem and Rome to Germany. He became Legation Councillor in Berlin, later Council Referee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In 1848 he received an appointment in the Prussian ministry for foreign affairs, and in 1853 was promoted to be privy councillor of legation (''Geheimer Legationsrath'').&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Abeken remained in charge for more than twenty years of Prussian politics, assisting [[Otto Theodor Freiherr von Manteuffel]] and Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]. The latter was so much pleased with Abeken's work that officials started to call Abeken &quot;the quill [i.e., the scribe] of Bismarck.&quot; Abeken married in 1866 [[Hedwig von Olfers]], daughter of the general director of the royal museums, [[Ignaz von Olfers|Privy Council von Olfers]].

He was much employed by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] in the writing of official despatches, and stood high in the favour of King William, whom he often accompanied on his journeys as representative of the foreign office.  He was present with the king during the campaigns of 1866 and 1870-71.  In 1851 he published anonymously ''Babylon und Jerusalem,'' a slashing criticism of the views of the [[Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn|Countess von Hahn-Hahn]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the war against Austria in 1866 as well as in the wars against France in 1870 and 1871, Abeken stayed in the Prussian headquarters. A major part of the dispatches of the time have been written by him. Unfortunately his health was damaged by the endeavours of these travels, and he died after an illness of several months. Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] described Abeken in a condolence letter to his widow: ''One of my most reliable advisors, standing on my side in the most decisive moments; His loss is irreplaceable to me; In him his fatherland has lost one of the most noble and most loyal men and officials.''

Despite his engagement in politics, Abeken never lost his interest in theology and continued to publish and speak in this sector during all of his life. He was interested in art and archeology, and was sponsor of the Archeological Institute of Rome and member of the Archeological Society of Rome. He founded a Circle of Friends of the Greek Literature in Berlin and was member of the prize commission for the royal Schiller-Prize.

See ''Heinrich Abeken, ein schlichtes Leben in bewegter Zeit'' (Berlin, 1898), by his widow.  This is valuable by reason of the letters written from the Prussian headquarters.

'''Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB|PC|FRS|FRHistS|JP|DL}} (16 April 1815{{snd}}25 February 1895) was a British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician, who served in government most notably as [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]] (1868–1873) and as [[Lord President of the Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and education ==
Henry Bruce was born at Duffryn, [[Aberdare]], [[Glamorganshire]], the son of John Bruce, a Glamorganshire landowner, and his first wife Sarah, daughter of Reverend Hugh Williams Austin. John Bruce's original family name was Knight, but on coming of age in 1805 he assumed the name of Bruce: his mother, through whom he inherited the Duffryn estate, was the daughter of William Bruce, high sheriff of Glamorganshire.

Henry was educated from the age of twelve at the [[Bishop Gore School]], [[Swansea]] ([[Bishop Gore School|Swansea Grammar School]]). In 1837 he was called to the [[barrister|bar]] from Lincoln's Inn.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rees|first1=James Frederick|title=Henry Austin Bruce|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BRUC-AUS-1815.html?query=henry+bruce&amp;field=name|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after he had begun to practice, the discovery of coal beneath the Duffryn and other Aberdare Valley [[estate (house)|estates]] brought his family great wealth.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aberdare, Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron|volume=1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1847 to 1854 Bruce was stipendiary magistrate for [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Aberdare]], resigning the position in the latter year, after entering parliament as Liberal member for [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]].

== Industrialist and politician, 1852–1868 ==
[[File:1stLordAberdare.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Aberdare, portrait after [[Henry Tanworth Wells]].]]
Bruce was returned unopposed as MP for Merthyr Tydfil in December 1852, following the death of Sir John Guest.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMG 18-12-52 Merthyr el&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Election of Henry Austin Bruce Esq. at Merthyr|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3090420/3090423/30/|accessdate=27 January 2016|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=18 December 1852|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did so with the enthusiastic support of the late member's political allies, notably the iron masters of Dowlais, and he was thereafter regarded by his political opponents, most notably  in the Aberdare Valley, as their nominee.{{sfn|Jones|1965|pp=253-4}} Even so, Bruce's parliamentary record demonstrated support for liberal policies, with the exception of the ballot.{{sfn|Jones|1965|p=254}} The electorate in the constituency at this time remained relatively small, excluding the vast majority of the working classes.

Significantly, however, Bruce's relationship with the miners of the Aberdare Valley, in particular, deteriorated as a result of the [[Aberdare Strike 1857-8|Aberdare Strike]] of 1857-8.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=166-9}} In a speech to a large audience of miners at the Aberdare Market Hall, Bruce sought to strike a conciliatory tone in persuading the miners to return to work. In a second speech, however, he delivered a broadside against the trade union movement generally, referring to the violence engendered elsewhere as a result of strikes and to alleged examples of intimidation and violence in the immediate locality.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMG 18571212&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Great Strike and the Colliers|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3294344/ART30|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|page=6|date=12 December 1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike damaged his reputation and may well have contributed to his eventual election defeat ten years later.  In 1855, Bruce was appointed a trustee of the [[GKN plc|Dowlais Iron Company]] and played a role in the further development of the iron industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBO&quot; /&gt;

In November 1862, after nearly ten years in Parliament, he became [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], and held that office until April 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBO&quot; /&gt; He became a [[Privy Councillor]] and a Charity Commissioner for England and Wales in 1864, when he was moved to be Vice-President of the Council of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage (2003), vol.I, pp.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1868 general election ==
At the 1868 General Election, Merthyr Tydfil became a two-member constituency with a much-increased electorate as a result of the Second Reform Act of 1867. Since the formation of the constituency, Merthyr Tydfil had dominated representation as the vast majority of the electorate lived in the town and its vicinity, whereas there was a much lower number of electors in the neighbouring Aberdare Valley.{{sfn|Jones|1965|p=251}} During the 1850s and 1860s, however, the population of Aberdare grew rapidly, and the franchise changes in 1867 gave the vote to large numbers of miners in that valley. Amongst these new electors, Bruce, as noted above, remained unpopular as a result of his actions during the 1857 -8 dispute. Initially, it appeared that the Aberdare iron master, [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]], would be elected to the second seat alongside Bruce. However, the appearance of a third Liberal candidate, [[Henry Richard]], a nonconformist radical popular in both Merthyr and Aberdare, left Bruce on the defensive and he was ultimately defeated, finishing in third place behind  both Richard and  Fothergill.

== Later political career ==
[[File:HenryAustinBruce.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue overlooking the Main Building of Cardiff University]]

After losing his seat, Bruce was elected for [[Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire]] on 25 January 1869, he was made Home Secretary by [[William Ewart Gladstone]].  His tenure of this office was conspicuous for a reform of the [[licensing laws]], and he was responsible for the [[Licensing Act 1872]], which made the [[magistrate]]s the licensing authority, increased the penalties for misconduct in public-houses and shortened the number of hours for the sale of drink. In 1873 Bruce relinquished the home secretaryship, at Gladstone's request, to become [[Lord President of the Council]], and was elevated to the peerage as [[Baron Aberdare]], of Duffryn in the County of Glamorgan, on 23 August that year.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage, 107th edn. (2003), p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Being a Gladstonian Liberal, Aberdare had hoped for a much more radical proposal to keep existing licensee holders for a further ten years, and to prevent any new applicants.  Its unpopularity pricked his nonconformist's conscience, when like Gladstone himself he had a strong leaning towards Temperance.  He had already pursued 'moral improvement' on miners in the regulations attempting to further ban boys from the pits. The Trades Union Act 1871 was another more liberal regime giving further rights to unions, and protection from malicious prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3732?docPos=2 | title = Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare | accessdate = 22 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Bruce, Vanity Fair, 1869-08-21 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Caricature of Bruce by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1869 with the caption ''&quot;He has gained credit by converting himself to the Ballot; he would gain greater credit by converting himself into an ex-secretary of State for the Home Department&quot;'']]
The defeat of the Liberal government in the following year terminated Lord Aberdare's official political life, and he subsequently devoted himself to social, educational and economic questions.  Education became one of Lord Aberdare's main interests in later life. His interest had been shown by the speech on Welsh education which he had made on 5 May 1862. In  1880, he was appointed to chair the Departmental Committee on Intermediate and Higher Education in Wales and Monmouthshire, whose report ultimately led to the Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBO&quot; /&gt; The report also stimulated the campaign for the provision of university education in  Wales. In 1883, Lord Aberdare was elected the first president of the [[Cardiff University|University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire]].  In his inaugural address he declared that the framework of Welsh education would not be complete until there was a [[University of Wales]]. The University was eventually founded in 1893 and Aberdare became its first chancellor.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBO&quot; /&gt;

In 1876 he was elected a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]]; from 1878 to 1891 he was president of the [[Royal Historical Society]].   and in 1881 he became president of both the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Girls' Public Day School Company|Girls' Day School Trust]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; In 1888 he headed the commission that established the [[Official Table of Drops]], listing how far a person of a particular weight should be dropped when hanged for a [[capital offence]] (the only method of '[[judicial execution]]' in the United Kingdom at that time), to ensure an instant and painless death, by cleanly breaking the neck between the 2nd and 3rd vertebrae, an 'exacting science', eventually brought to perfection by Chief Executioner [[Albert Pierrepoint]]. Prisoners health, clothing and discipline was a particular concern even at the end of his career.  In the Lords he spoke at some length to the Home Affairs Committee chaired by Arthur Balfour about the prison rules system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://parlipapers.proquest.com/parlipapers/result/pqpdocumentview?accountid=15133&amp;groupid=94436&amp;pgId=3b9ca55d-4995-45b4-bf64-7d64518a9344&amp;rsId=1588C65E621 | title= Prison Rules Inquiry | date= 16 April 1889 | accessdate = 22 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberdare had always maintained a healthy skepticism about intemperate working-classes; in 1878 urging greater vigilance against the vice of excessive drinking, he took evidence on miners and railway colliers habitual imbibing.  The committee tried racinate special legislation based on a link between Sunday Opening and absenteeism established in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Select Committee of House of Lords for inquiring into Prevalence of Habits of Intemperance, and Effects of Recent Legislation, Fourth Report, Minutes of Evidence, Appendix, Index | url = http://parlipapers.proquest.com/parlipapers/result/pqpdocumentview?accountid=15133&amp;groupid=94436&amp;pgId=de08e832-4e72-410e-8e6a-75baae953db1&amp;rsId=1588C65E621#1067 | date = 22 February 1878 | accessdate = 22 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberdare had been interested in the plight of working class drinkers since Gladstone had appointed him Home Secretary.  The defeat of the Licensing Bill by the Tory 'beerage' and publicans was drafted to limit hours and protect the public, but it persuaded a convinced Anglican forever more of the iniquities.

In 1882 he began a connection with West Africa which lasted the rest of his life, by accepting the chairmanship of the [[National African Company]], formed by [[George Taubman Goldie|Sir George Goldie]], which in 1886 received a charter under the title of the [[Royal Niger Company]] and in 1899 was taken over by the British government, its territories being constituted the protectorate of [[Nigeria]]. West African affairs, however, by no means exhausted Lord Aberdare's energies, and it was principally through his efforts that a charter was in 1894 obtained for the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire,a constituent institution of the University of Wales. This is now [[Cardiff University]]. Lord Aberdare, who in 1885 was made a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]], presided over several [[Royal Commission]]s at different times.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Halophiles''' are organisms that thrive in high [[salt]] concentrations.  They are a type of [[extremophile]] organisms.  The name comes from the Greek word for &quot;salt-loving&quot;. While most halophiles are classified into the [[Archaea]] domain, there are also [[bacteria]]l halophiles and some [[eukaryota]], such as the [[alga]] ''[[Dunaliella salina]]'' or [[fungus]] ''[[Wallemia ichthyophaga]]''. Some well-known species give off a red color from carotenoid compounds, notably [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. Halophiles can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five times greater than the salt concentration of the ocean, such as the [[Great Salt Lake]] in Utah, [[Owens Lake]] in California, the [[Dead Sea]], and in [[evaporation pond]]s.

== Classification ==
Halophiles are categorized as slight, moderate, or extreme, by the extent of their [[halotolerance]]. Slight halophiles prefer 0.3 to 0.8 M (1.7 to 4.8% — seawater is 0.6 M or 3.5%), moderate halophiles 0.8 to 3.4 M (4.7 to 20%), and extreme halophiles 3.4 to 5.1 M (20 to 30%) salt content.&lt;ref name=Ollivier&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ollivier | first1 = B. | last2 = Caumette | first2 = P. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = J-L. | last4 = Mah | first4 = R. | year = 1994 | title = Anaerobic bacteria from hypersaline environments | url = | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 27–38 | pmc = 372951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Halophiles require sodium chloride (salt) for growth, in contrast to halotolerant organisms, which do not require salt but can grow under saline conditions.

== Lifestyle ==
High salinity represents an extreme environment to which relatively few organisms have been able to adapt and occupy. Most halophilic and all [[halotolerance|halotolerant]] organisms expend energy to exclude salt from their [[cytoplasm]] to avoid protein aggregation ('[[salting out]]'). To survive the high salinities, halophiles employ two differing strategies to prevent [[desiccation]] through [[osmosis|osmotic]] movement of water out of their cytoplasm. Both strategies work by increasing the internal [[osmolarity]] of the cell. In the first (which is employed by the majority of halophilic bacteria, some [[archaea]], [[yeast]]s, [[algae]] and [[fungi]]), [[organic compounds]] are accumulated in the cytoplasm — [[osmoprotectant]]s which are known as compatible solutes. These can be either synthesised or accumulated from the environment.&lt;ref name=Santos&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Santos | first1 = H. | last2 = da Costa | first2 = M.S. | year = 2002 | title = Compatible solutes of organisms that live in hot saline environments | url = | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 501–509 | doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.2002.00335.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common compatible solutes are [[pH|neutral]] or [[zwitterionic]], and include [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar]]s, [[polyol]]s, [[betaine]]s, and [[ectoine]]s, as well as derivatives of some of these compounds.

The second, more radical, adaptation involves the selective influx of [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions into the cytoplasm. This adaptation is restricted to the moderately halophilic bacterial order [[Halanaerobiales]], the extremely halophilic archaeal family [[Halobacteriaceae]], and the extremely halophilic bacterium ''[[Salinibacter ruber]]''. The presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineages suggests [[convergent evolution]] of this strategy, it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer.&lt;ref name=Santos/&gt; The primary reason for this is the entire intracellular machinery (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high salt levels, whereas in the compatible solute adaptation, little or no adjustment is required to intracellular macromolecules; in fact, the compatible solutes often act as more general stress protectants, as well as just osmoprotectants.&lt;ref name=Santos/&gt;

Of particular note are the extreme halophiles or [[haloarchaea]] (often known as [[halobacteria]]), a group of archaea, which require at least a 2 M salt concentration and are usually found in saturated solutions (about 36% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)#Usage in biology|w/v]] salts). These are the primary inhabitants of salt lakes, inland seas, and evaporating ponds of seawater, such as the deep [[saltern]]s, where they tint the water column and sediments bright colors. These species  most likely perish if they are exposed to anything other than a very high-concentration, salt-conditioned environment. These prokaryotes require salt for growth. The high concentration of sodium chloride in their environment limits the availability of oxygen for respiration. Their cellular machinery is adapted to high salt concentrations by having charged [[amino acid]]s on their surfaces, allowing the retention of water molecules around these components. They are [[heterotroph]]s that normally respire by aerobic means. Most halophiles are unable to survive outside their high-salt native environments. Indeed, many cells are so fragile that when placed in distilled water, they immediately [[cytolysis|lyse]] from the change in osmotic conditions.

Halophiles may use a variety of energy sources. They can be aerobic or anaerobic. Anaerobic halophiles include phototrophic, fermentative, sulfate-reducing, homoacetogenic, and methanogenic species.&lt;ref name=Ollivier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oren | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Diversity of halophilic microorganisms:  Environments, phylogeny, physiology and applications | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology &amp; Biotechnology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1038/sj/jim/7000176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haloarchaea, and particularly the family Halobacteriaceae, are members of the domain [[Archaea]], and comprise the majority of the prokaryotic population in [[hypersaline lake|hypersaline environments]].&lt;ref name=Oren&gt;Oren, A. (2002) Molecular ecology of extremely halophilic Archaea and Bacteria.

A comparatively wide range of taxa has been isolated from saltern crystalliser ponds, including members of these genera: ''Haloferax, Halogeometricum, Halococcus, Haloterrigena, Halorubrum, Haloarcula'', and ''Halobacterium''.&lt;ref name=Oren /&gt; However, the viable counts in these cultivation studies have been small when compared to total counts, and the numerical significance of these isolates has been unclear. Only recently has it become possible to determine the identities and relative abundances of organisms in natural populations, typically using [[PCR]]-based strategies that target 16[[Svedberg|S]] small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) genes. While comparatively few studies of this type have been performed, results from these suggest that some of the most readily isolated and studied genera may not in fact be significant in the ''in situ'' community. This is seen in cases such as the genus ''[[Haloarcula]]'', which is estimated to make up less than 0.1% of the'' in situ'' community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anton | first1 = J. | last2 = Llobet-Brossa | first2 = E. | last3 = Rodriguez-Valera | first3 = F. | last4 = Amann | first4 = R. | year = 1999 | title = Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the prokaryotic community inhabiting crystallizer ponds | url = | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 517–523 | doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.1999.00065.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but commonly appears in isolation studies.

== Genomic and proteomic signature of halophiles ==

The comparative genomic and proteomic analysis showed  distinct molecular signatures exist for environmental adaptation of halophiles. At the protein level, the halophilic species are characterized by low hydrophobicity, overrepresentation of acidic residues, underrepresentation of Cys, lower propensities for helix formation, and higher propensities for coil structure. The core of these proteins is less hydrophobic, such as [[DHFR]], that was found to have narrower β-strands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kastritis | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Papandreou | first2 = N.C. | last3 = Hamodrakas | first3 = S.J. | year = 2007 | title = Haloadaptation: insights from comparative modeling studies of halophilic archaeal DHFRs | url = | journal = Int J Biol Mac | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 447–453 | doi=10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2007.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Halobacterium]]''&lt;ref&gt;NCBI taxonomy resources (2007) [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&amp;id=2239 webpage on Halobacterium]&lt;/ref&gt; is a genus of the Archaea that has a high tolerance for elevated levels of salinity. Some species of halobacteria have acidic proteins that resist the denaturing effects of salts. ''[[Halococcus]]'' is a specific genus of the family Halobacteriaceae.

Some [[hypersaline lake]]s are a habitat to numerous families of halophiles. For example, the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]] in [[Botswana]]  form a vast, seasonal, high-salinity water body that manifests halophilic species within the [[diatom]] genus ''[[Nitzschia]]'' in the family [[Bacillariaceae]], as well as species within the genus ''[[Lovenula]]'' in the family [[Diaptomidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

The fermentation of salty foods (such as [[soy sauce]], [[douchi|Chinese fermented beans]], [[salted cod]], salted [[Anchovies as food|anchovies]], [[sauerkraut]], etc.) often involves halobacteria, as either essential ingredients or accidental contaminants.  One example is ''[[Chromohalobacter beijerinckii]]'', found in salted beans preserved in brine and in salted [[herring]]. ''[[Tetragenococcus halophilus]]'' is found in salted anchovies and soy sauce.

'''Herbert Alexander Simon''' (June 15, 1916&amp;nbsp;– February 9, 2001) was an American [[political scientist]], [[economist]], [[sociologist]], [[psychologist]], and [[computer scientist]] whose research ranged across the fields of [[cognitive psychology]], [[cognitive science]], computer science, [[public administration]], economics, management, [[philosophy of science]], sociology, and [[political science]], unified by studies of [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name=edward2001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/291/5511/2107.full |title=Herbert A.

Simon was among the pioneers of several of today's important scientific domains, including [[artificial intelligence]], [[information processing]], [[decision-making]], [[problem-solving]], [[organization theory]], [[complex systems]], and computer simulation of [[scientific discovery]].
He coined the terms ''[[bounded rationality]]'' and ''[[satisficing]]'', and was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a [[preferential attachment]] mechanism to explain [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name=simon&gt;Simon, H. A., 1955, Biometrika 42, 425.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Mandelbrot, A note on a class of skew distribution functions, Analysis and critique of a paper by H. Simon, Information and Control, 2 (1959), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon received many top-level honors in life, including the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1978 and the [[Turing Award]] in 1975.
He also received honorary degrees from various universities, such as from Harvard University.
As of 2016, Simon was the most cited person in [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Cognitive Psychology]] on [[Google Scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9d7rMrkAAAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;
With almost a thousand highly cited publications, he was one of the most influential social scientists of the twentieth century.

For many years he held the post of [[Richard King Mellon]] Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|title=Nobel Lectures, Economics 1969–1980|year=1978|publisher=[[World Scientific|World Scientific Publishing Co.]]|location=Singapore|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/simon-facts.html|editor=Assar Lindbeck|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a testament to his interdisciplinary approach, Simon was affiliated with such varied Carnegie Mellon departments as the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science]], [[Tepper School of Business]], departments of Philosophy, [[Social and Decision Sciences]], and Psychology.

==Early life and education==
Herbert Alexander Simon was born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] on June 15, 1916. His father, Arthur Simon (1881–1948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from [[Germany]] in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the [[Technische Hochschule]] of [[Darmstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1991, p.3, 23&lt;/ref&gt; An inventor who was granted &quot;several dozen patents&quot;, his father also was an independent patent attorney.&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1991 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from [[Prague]] and [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon 1991 p.3&quot;&gt;Simon 1991 p.3&lt;/ref&gt; His European ancestors had been piano makers, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[vintner]]s. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon 1991 p.3&quot;/&gt; Simon called himself an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Herbert A. Simon: The Bounds of Reason in Modern America|year=2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801880254|page=22|author=Hunter Crowther-Heyck|quote=His secular, scientific values came well before he was old enough to make such calculating career decisions. For example, while still in middle school, Simon wrote a letter to the editor of the Milwaukee Journal defending the civil liberties of atheists, and by high school he was &quot;certain&quot; that he was &quot;religiously an atheist,&quot; a conviction that never wavered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon was educated as a child in the public school system in Milwaukee where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother’s younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] under [[John R. Commons]]. Through his uncle’s books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]]’s economics textbook, [[Norman Angell]]’s ''[[The Great Illusion]]'', and [[Henry George]]’s ''[[Progress and Poverty]]''. At that time, Simon argued &quot;from conviction, rather than cussedness&quot; in favor of George's controversial [[Georgism|'single tax']] on land rents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Velupillai, Kumaraswamy 2000&quot;&gt;Velupillai, Kumaraswamy. Computable economics : the Arne Ryde memorial lectures. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Simon entered the [[University of Chicago]], and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics. He was interested in biology, but chose not to study it because of his &quot;color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1991 p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He chose instead to focus on political science and economics. His most important mentor at the University was [[Henry Schultz]] who was an econometrician and mathematical economist.&lt;ref name=nobelAutoBiog/&gt;  Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in [[political science]], from the University of Chicago, where he studied under [[Harold Lasswell]], Nicholas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and [[Charles Edward Merriam]].&lt;ref&gt;Augier &amp; March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

After enrolling in a course on &quot;Measuring Municipal Governments,&quot; Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, with whom he coauthored the book, ''Measuring Municipal Activities'', in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1991 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; the same year that he and Dorothea married. Eventually his studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which would become the [[Administrative Behavior#Background|subject of his doctoral dissertation]].

==Academic career==
After graduating with his undergraduate degree, Simon obtained a research assistantship in municipal administration which turned into a directorship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

From 1942 to 1949, Simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]]. There, he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the [[Cowles Commission]] who at that time included [[Trygve Haavelmo]], [[Jacob Marschak]], and [[Tjalling Koopmans]]. He thus began a more in-depth study of economics in the area of [[Institutional economics|institutionalism]]. Marschak brought Simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with [[Sam Schurr]] of the “prospective economic effects of atomic energy”.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel autobio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/simon-bio.html|title=Herbert A. Simon – Biographical|website=nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1949 to 2001, Simon was a faculty at [[Carnegie Mellon]]. In 1949, Simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the Department of Industrial Management at [[Carnegie Tech]] (later to become [[Carnegie Mellon University]]). Simon later also&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1991 p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; taught [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] in the same university,&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel autobio&quot; /&gt; (occasionally visiting other universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/faculty-1949 Princeton University, Department Of Philosophy, Faculty Since 1949, at philosophy.princeton.edu accessed 2014-Oct-13]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Personal life and interests==
Simon married Dorothea Pye in 1938. Their marriage lasted 63 years until his death from a cancerous tumor. In January 2001, Simon underwent surgery at UPMC Presbyterian to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen. Although the surgery was successful, Simon later succumbed to the complications that followed.

They had three children, Katherine, Peter, and Barbara. His wife died in 2002, during the year following his death in 2001.&lt;ref name=DorotheaSObit/&gt;

From 1950 to 1955, Simon studied mathematical economics and during this time, together with [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]], discovered and proved the [[Hawkins–Simon theorem]] on the “conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for input-output matrices.&quot;  He also developed theorems on near-decomposability and aggregation. Having begun to apply these theorems to organizations, by 1954 Simon determined that the best way to study problem-solving was to simulate it with computer programs, which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition. Founded during the 1950s, he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Simon had a keen interest in the arts, as he was a pianist. He was a friend of [[Robert Lepper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Robert_Lepper_Artist_Teacher.pdf |title=PR_Robert_Lepper_Artist_Teacher.pdf |accessdate=2008-05-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626151911/http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Robert_Lepper_Artist_Teacher.pdf |archivedate=June 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Rappaport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.library.cmu.edu/client/default/q$003dlepper$0026rw$003d0$0026d$003dent$00253A$00252F$00252FSD_ILS$00252F1380$00252FSD_ILS$00253A1380888$00253AILS$00253A3$00253A636$0026tt$003dDIRECT$0026|title=Home - Carnegie Mellon University Libraries|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappaport also painted Simon's commissioned portrait at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel autobio&quot; /&gt;

==Works==
Seeking to replace the highly simplified classical approach to economic modeling, Simon became best known for his theory of corporate decision in his book ''Administrative Behavior''. In this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making. His organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman, but he also played a big part in the creation of the Economic Cooperation Administration in 1948; administrative team that administered aid to the Marshall Plan for the U. S Government, serving on President Johnson's Science Advisory Committee, and also the National Academy of Science.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel autobio&quot;/&gt;  Herbert Simon has made a great number of profound and in depth contributions to both economic analysis and applications. Because of this, his work can be found in a number of economic literary works, making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem, human rationality, behavioral study of firms, theory of casual ordering, and the analysis of the identification problem in econometrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumol | first1 = William J | year = 1979 | title = On The Contributions of Herbert A.

==Study of decision-making==

{{Quotation|I am a monomaniac. What I am a monomaniac about is decision-making.&lt;ref name=edward2001/&gt;}}

''Administrative Behavior'',&lt;ref name=&quot;BarnardSimon1947&quot;&gt;C. Barnard and H. A. Simon. (1947). ''Administrative behavior. A study of decision-making processes in administrative organization''. Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
first appearing in 1947, and updated across the years&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon1976&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on Simon’s doctoral dissertation. It served as the foundation for his life's work. The centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational choices, that is, decisions. By his definition, an operational administrative decision should be correct and efficient, and it must be practical to implement with a set of coordinated means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon1976&quot;/&gt;
	
Simon recognised that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making, and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology. He states:
{{Quotation|[If] there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren. It would consist of the single precept: Always select that alternative, among those available, which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon1976&quot;/&gt; (p xxviii)}}

Contrary to the &quot;homo economicus&quot; stereotype, Simon argued that alternatives and consequences may be partly known, and means and ends imperfectly differentiated, incompletely related, or poorly detailed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon1976&quot;/&gt;

Simons defined the task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences. Correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by:
# the adequacy of achieving the desired objective;
# the efficiency with which the result was obtained.

The task of choice was divided into three required steps:

# Identifying and listing all the alternatives;
# Determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives; and
# Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements. Simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives, or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarnardSimon1947&quot;/&gt;

Simon attempted to determine the techniques and/or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making.&lt;ref name=Simon1976/&gt; Simon writes:

{{quote|The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties. These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Simon therefore, describes work in terms of an economic framework, conditioned on human cognitive limitations: Economic man and Administrative man.

''Administrative Behavior'', as a text, addresses a wide range of human behaviors, cognitive abilities, management techniques, personnel policies, training goals and procedures, specialized roles, criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, and all of the ramifications of communication processes. Simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions, both directly and indirectly.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Simons argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy, but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Simon followed [[Chester Barnard]] who pointed out that “the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnard|1938|p=77}} cited by {{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp= 202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization, and continue to be made in his or her extra–organizational private life. As a member of an organization, however, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent, purpose, and effect. Organizational inducements, rewards, and sanctions are all designed to form, strengthen, and maintain this identification.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Simon&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon1976&quot;/&gt; saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals: Authority (addressed in Chapter VII—The Role of Authority) and in Loyalties and Identification (Addressed in Chapter X: Loyalties, and Organizational Identification).

Authority is a well studied, primary mark of organizational behavior, straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank. The actions, attitudes, and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form, style, and content, but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status, and willingness to obey from the subordinate.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Loyalty was defined by Simon as the &quot;process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives (service objectives or conservation objectives) for his own aims as the value-indices which determine his organizational decisions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp= 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for onself or ones family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp= 206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following [[Lasswell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lasswell|1935|pp=29–51}} cited by {{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Simon has been critical of traditional economics’ elementary understanding of decision-making, and argues it &quot;is too quick to build an idealistic, unrealistic picture of the decision-making process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert. https://www.ubs.com/microsites/nobel-perspectives/en/herbert-simon.html&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to research in the area of administrative decision-making have become increasingly mainstream in the business community.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Artificial intelligence and psychology==
Simon was a pioneer in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], creating with [[Allen Newell]] the [[Logic Theorist|Logic Theory Machine]] (1956) and the [[General Problem Solver]] (GPS) (1957) programs. GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems. Both programs were developed using the [[Information Processing Language]] (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell, [[Cliff Shaw]], and Simon. [[Donald Knuth]] mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the [[linked list]] originally called &quot;NSS memory&quot; for its inventors.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 1 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Simon predicted that [[computer chess]] would surpass human chess abilities within &quot;ten years&quot; when, in reality, that transition took about forty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/184405171 Computer Chess: The Drosophila of AI] October 30, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s psychologist [[Ulric Neisser]] asserted that while machines are capable of replicating 'cold cognition' behaviors such as reasoning, planning, perceiving, and deciding, they would never be able to replicate '[[hot cognition]]' behaviors such as pain, pleasure, desire, and other emotions. Simon responded to Neisser's views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Simon, [http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&amp;item=346072 A Theory of Emotional Behavior]. Carnegie Mellon University Complex Information Processing (CIP) Working Paper #55, June 1, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; which he updated in 1967 and published in ''Psychological Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Simon, [http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&amp;item=34512 Motivational and Emotional Controls of Cognition]. ''Psychological Review'', 1967, Vol. 74, No. 1, 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years, but subsequent work on emotions by [[Aaron Sloman|Sloman]] and [[Rosalind Picard|Picard]] helped refocus attention on Simon's paper and eventually, made it highly influential on the topic.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Simon also collaborated with [[James G. March]] on several works in [[organization theory]].&lt;ref name=edward2001/&gt;

With [[Allen Newell]], Simon developed a [[theory]] for the [[simulation]] of human [[problem solving]] behavior using production rules.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, ''Human Problem Solving'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The study of human [[problem solving]] required new kinds of human measurements and, with [[Anders Ericsson]], Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Ericsson and H. A. Simon, ''Protocol Analysis: Verbal Reports as Data'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise. He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)|chunks]] of information. A [[chess]] [[expert]] was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Simon. Perception in Chess. [[Cognitive Psychology]] Volume 4, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Turing Award|A.M. Turing Award]] along with [[Allen Newell]] in 1975. &quot;In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with [[Cliff Shaw|J. C. (Cliff) Shaw]] at the [[RAND Corporation]], and {{Sic|nolink=y|subsequent|ially|expected=subsequently}} with numerous faculty and student colleagues at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], they have made basic contributions to [[artificial intelligence]], the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/simon_1031467.cfm|title=Herbert A. Simon - A.M. Turing Award Winner|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Simon was interested in how humans learn and, with [[Edward Feigenbaum]], he developed the [[EPAM]] (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, one of the first theories of [[learning]] to be implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feigenbaum | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Simon | first2 = H. A. | year = 1984 | title = EPAM-like models of recognition and learning | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 305–336 | doi=10.1016/s0364-0213(84)80005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the model were applied to [[concept formation]] and the acquisition of [[expertise]]. With [[Fernand Gobet]], he has expanded the EPAM theory into the [[CHREST]] computational model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gobet | first1 = F. | last2 = Simon | first2 = H. A. | year = 2000 | title = Five seconds or sixty? Presentation time in expert memory | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 651–682 | doi=10.1016/s0364-0213(00)00031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory explains how simple [[chunking (psychology)|chunks]] of information form the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Sociology and economics==
Simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in [[microeconomics]]. He is responsible for the concept of organizational decision-making as it is known today. He also was the first to discuss this concept in terms of uncertainty; i.e. it is impossible to have perfect and complete information at any given time to make a decision. While this notion was not entirely new, Simon is best known for its origination. It was in this area that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: STUDIES OF DECISION-MAKING LEAD TO PRIZE IN ECONOMICS|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=16 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Cowles Commission]], Simon’s main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics. His main contributions were to the fields of [[general equilibrium]] and [[econometrics]]. He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit-maximization was not accomplished, in part, because of the lack of complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only “[[bounded rationality]]” and must make decisions by “[[satisficing]],” or choosing that which might not be optimal, but which will make them happy enough. Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory.

Further, Simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a &quot;procedural&quot; definition of rationality, whereas economists employ a &quot;substantive&quot; definition. Gustavos Barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Barros, Gustavo. 2010. &quot;Herbert A. Simon And The Concept of Rationality : Boundaries and Procedures&quot;. Rev. Econ. Polit. 30(3): 445-472&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in an earlier article, Bhargava (1997) noted the importance of Simon's arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the &quot;procedural&quot; definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health. In particular, economists should employ &quot;auxiliary assumptions&quot; that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields, and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes.

Simon was also known for his research on industrial organization. He determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof, did not conform to the Neoclassical theories of “rational” decision-making. Simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life mainly focusing on the issue of decision-making within the behavior of what he termed “[[bounded rationality]]”. “Rational behavior, in economics, means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face (e.g., their budget constraint, limited choices, ...) in pursuit of their self-interest. This is reflected in the theory of [[subjective expected utility]]. The term, [[bounded rationality]], is used to designate rational choice that takes into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity. Bounded rationality is a central theme in [[behavioral economics]]. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision-making process influences decisions. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory”.{{cite quote|date=September 2013}}

Simon determined that the best way to study these areas was through computer simulation modeling. As such, he developed an interest in computer science. Simon's main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems, the use of computers to study (by modeling) philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of [[epistemology]], and the social implications of computer technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In his youth, Simon took an interest in [[land economics]] and [[Georgism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Velupillai, Kumaraswamy 2000&quot;/&gt; an idea known at the time as 'single tax'. The system is meant to redistribute unearned [[economic rent]] to the public and improve land use. In 1979, Simon still maintained these ideas and argued that [[land value tax]] should replace taxes on wages.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert. Letter to the Pittsburgh City Council, December 13, 1979. Archived in the Herbert A. Simon Collected Papers, Carnegie Mellon University Library. http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/batt-h-william_real-explanation-for-the-tax-rebellion-2011.pdf Quote: &quot;It is clearly preferable to impose the additional cost on land by increasing the land tax, rather than to increase the wage tax&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Simon's economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Pedagogy==
Simon's work has strongly influenced [[John Mighton]], developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvo&quot;&gt;&quot;John Mighton: The Ubiquitous Bell Curve&quot;, in ''[[Big Ideas (TV series)|Big Ideas]]'' on [[TVOntario]], broadcast 1:30 a.m., 6 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Mighton cites a 2000 paper by Simon and two co-authors that counters arguments by French mathematics educator, [[Guy Brousseau]], and others suggesting that excessive practice hampers children's understanding:&lt;ref name=&quot;tvo&quot; /&gt;

{{Quotation|[The] criticism of practice (called 'drill and kill,' as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation) is prominent in constructivist writings. Nothing flies more in the face of the last 20 years of research than the assertion that practice is bad. All evidence, from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals, indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice... In denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence. The instructional task is not to 'kill' motivation by demanding drill, but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest.|[[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R. Anderson]], Lynne M. Reder, and Herbert A.

'''Hematite''', [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled as]] '''haematite''', is the [[mineral]] form of [[iron(III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), one of several [[iron oxide]]s. It is the oldest known Fe oxide mineral and is widespread in rocks and soils&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hematite crystallizes in the [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral lattice system]], and it has the same [[crystal]] structure as [[ilmenite]] and [[corundum]]. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete [[solid solution]] at temperatures above {{convert|950|C|F}}.

Hematite is colored black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is [[mining|mined]] as the [[Iron ore#Hematite ore|main ore of iron]]. Varieties include ''kidney ore'', ''martite'' ([[pseudomorph]]s after [[magnetite]]), ''iron rose'' and ''specularite'' (specular hematite). While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak. Hematite is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle. [[Maghemite]] is a hematite- and [[magnetite]]-related oxide mineral.

Huge deposits of hematite are found in [[banded iron formation]]s. Gray hematite is typically found in places that can have still standing water or mineral [[hot spring]]s, such as those in [[Yellowstone National Park]] in [[North America]]. The mineral can [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of water and collect in layers at the bottom of a lake, spring, or other standing water. Hematite can also occur without water, however, usually as the result of [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity.

[[Clay]]-sized hematite crystals can also occur as a secondary mineral formed by [[weathering]] processes in [[soil]], and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as [[goethite]], is responsible for the red color of many [[tropical]], ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.

==Etymology and history==
{{Main article|Ochre}}
The name hematite is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for blood [[wikt:αἷμα|αἷμα]] ''haima,'' due to the red coloration found in some varieties of hematite&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;. The color of hematite lends itself to use as a [[pigment]]. The English name of the stone is derived from [[Middle French]]: Hématite Pierre, which was imported from [[Latin]]: Lapis Hæmatites around the 15th century, which originated from [[Ancient Greek]]: αἱματίτης λίθος (''haimatitēs'' lithos, &quot;blood-red stone&quot;).

[[Ochre]] is a clay that is colored by varying amounts of hematite, varying between 20% and 70%.&lt;ref name=&quot;MZ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Ochre|work = Industrial Minerals|publisher = Minerals  Zone |url = http://www.mineralszone.com/minerals/ochre.html |accessdate = 2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red ochre contains unhydrated hematite, whereas yellow ochre contains [[hydrate]]d hematite ([[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • [[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]). The principal use of ochre is for tinting with a permanent color.&lt;ref name=&quot;MZ&quot; /&gt;

The [[Sanguine|red chalk]] writing of this mineral was one of the earliest in the history of humans. The powdery mineral was first used 164,000 years ago by the [[Pinnacle-Point man]] possibly for social purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Researchers find earliest evidence for modern human behavior in South Africa |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-10/asu-rfe101207.php |location= |publisher=AAAS |agency=ASU News |date=17 October 2007 |access-date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hematite residues are also found in graves from 80,000 years ago. Near Rydno in [[Poland]] and Lovas in [[Hungary]] red chalk mines have been found that are from 5000 BC, belonging to the [[Linear Pottery culture]] at the [[Upper Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levato|first=Chiara|year=2016|title=Iron Oxides Prehistoric Mines A European Overview|url=http://new-biblio.naturalsciences.be/associated_publications/studia-praehistorica-belgica/8/haematite_pdf-rgb-600_vol2_201216_p/009-023_3-1_levato_ironoxydes_201016_rgb-600-p.pdf|journal=Anthropologica et Præhistorica|volume=126|pages=9–23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich deposits of hematite have been found on the island of [[Elba]] that have been mined since the time of the [[Etruscans]].

==Magnetism==
Hematite is an [[antiferromagnetic]] material below the [[Morin transition]] at 250&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]] (K) or -9.7&amp;nbsp;degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (°F), and a [[Spin canting|canted]] antiferromagnet or weakly [[ferromagnetic]] above the Morin transition and below its [[Néel temperature]] at 948 K, above which it is [[paramagnetic]].

The magnetic structure of a-hematite was the subject of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny [[magnetic moment]] (0.002 µ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the [[Ion#Anions and cations|cation]] sites allows [[spin–orbit coupling]] to cause [[spin canting|canting of the moments]] when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the [[anisotropy]] which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Dzyaloshinsky, I. | title= A thermodynamic theory of &quot;weak&quot; ferromagnetism of antiferromagnetics| journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids| volume=4| page = 241|year =1958|doi= 10.1016/0022-3697(58)90076-3| issue = 4|bibcode = 1958JPCS....4..241D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Moriya, T. |title= Anisotropic Superexchange Interaction and Weak Ferromagnetism|journal = Phys. Rev.|volume= 120| page = 91|year =1960|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.120.91|bibcode = 1960PhRv..120...91M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the hematite [[nanoparticles]], and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. Hematite is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Dang, M.-Z. |author2=Rancourt, D.G. |author3=Dutrizac, J.E. |author4=Lamarche, G. |author5=Provencher, R. |title=Interplay of  Surface Conditions, Particle Size, Stoichiometry, Cell Parameters, and Magnetism in Synthetic Hematite-like Materials|journal=Hyperfine Interactions|volume=117|year=1998|pages=271–319|doi=10.1023/A:1012655729417|bibcode = 1998HyInt.117..271D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.

Enhanced magnetic coercivities for hematite have been achieved by dry-heating a 2-line ferrihydrite precursor prepared from solution. Hematite exhibited temperature-dependent magnetic coercivity values ranging from 289 to 5,027 Oe. The origin of these high coercivity values has been interpreted as a consequence of the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and [[crystallite]] size growth rates at increasing annealing temperature. These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale. At lower temperatures (350–600&amp;nbsp;°C), single particles crystallize however; at higher temperatures (600-1000&amp;nbsp;°C), the growth of crystalline aggregates with a subparticle structure is favored.&lt;ref&gt;Vallina, B., Rodriguez-Blanco, J.D., Brown, A.P., Benning, L.G. and Blanco, J.A.

==Mine tailings==
Hematite is present in the waste [[tailings]] of [[iron mines]].  A recently developed process, [[magnetation (iron ore)|magnetation]], uses magnets to glean waste hematite from old mine tailings in [[Minnesota]]'s vast [[Mesabi Range]] iron district.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, Chris.

The spectral signature of hematite was seen on the planet [[Mars]] by the infrared [[spectrometer]] on the [[NASA]] [[Mars Global Surveyor]] (&quot;MGS&quot;) and [[2001 Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft in orbit around Mars.&lt;ref&gt;NASA MGS TES Press Release, May 27, 1998 {{cite web|url=http://tes.asu.edu/webdata/hematitepr.html |title=&quot;Mars Global Surveyor TES Instrument Identification of Hematite on Mars&quot; |accessdate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513161834/http://tes.asu.edu/webdata/hematitepr.html |archivedate=May 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral was seen in abundance at two sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandfield, J.L.|title= Global mineral distributions on Mars|journal= J.

In-situ investigations by the [[Opportunity rover]] showed a significant amount of hematite, much of it in the form of small [[Martian spherules|spherules]] that were informally named &quot;blueberries&quot; by the science team.  Analysis indicates that these spherules are apparently [[concretion]]s formed from a water solution.
&quot;Knowing just how the hematite on Mars was formed will help us characterize the past environment and determine whether that environment was favorable for life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/hematite01.html Hematite]. NASA. Last Updated: 12 Jul 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry==
Hematite's popularity in jewelry was at its highest in Europe during the [[Victorian era]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Certain types of hematite or iron oxide-rich clay, especially [[Armenian bole]], have been used in [[gilding]]. Hematite is also used in art such as in the creation of [[Intaglio (jewelry)|intaglio engraved gems]]. [[Hematine]] is a synthetic material sold as ''magnetic hematite''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-35948.html Magnetic hematite]. Mindat.org (2011-06-18). Retrieved on 2011-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right|caption=The percentage of marine animal extinction at the [[genus]] level through the five [[mass extinction]]s}}

The  '''Holocene extinction''', otherwise referred to as the '''Sixth extinction''' or '''Anthropocene extinction''', is the ongoing [[extinction event]] of [[species]] during the present [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], mainly due to human activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldScientists&quot;/&gt; The large number of extinctions spans numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s. With widespread degradation of [[Biodiversity hotspot|highly biodiverse]] habitats such as [[coral reef]]s and [[rainforest]], as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions is thought to be ''undocumented''. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.

The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as [[megafauna]], starting at the end of the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. Megafauna outside of the [[African continent]], which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation, and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (additionally, many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]]). These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]–[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].

The arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction. The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.

The ecology of humanity has been noted as being that of an unprecedented &quot;global superpredator&quot; that regularly preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. Extinctions of species have occurred on every [[land mass]] and [[ocean]], with many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be characterized by the [[human impact on the environment]]. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with [[Meat#Environmental impact|meat consumption]], [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[Decline in amphibian populations|amphibian crisis]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[Human impact on the environment#Biodiversity|decline in biodiversity]]. [[Human overpopulation]] (and continued [[Human population growth|population growth]]) along with [[Overconsumption|profligate consumption]] are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline.&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PimmJenkins&quot;/&gt;

The Holocene extinction is also known as the &quot;sixth extinction&quot;, due to its possibly being the sixth mass extinct event, after the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]], the [[Late Devonian extinction]], the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], and the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ceballos/&gt;&lt;ref name=dirzo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zalasiewicz2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldScientists&quot;/&gt; There is no general agreement on where the Holocene, or [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], extinction begins, and the [[Quaternary extinction event]], which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last [[ice age]], ends, or if they should be considered separate events at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doughty, C.

While a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt; Scientists that are employing a variance of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus, not originating as early as the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Recent research, based on [[archeology|archaeological]] and [[paleontology|paleontological]] digs on 70 different Pacific islands has shown that numerous species became extinct as people moved across the Pacific, starting 30,000 years ago in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steadman|Martin|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently estimated that among the bird species of the Pacific, some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans, representing a 20% drop in the biodiversity of birds worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steadman|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] was once home to a [[Australian megafauna|large assemblage of megafauna]], with many parallels to those found on the African continent today. Australia's fauna is characterised by primarily [[marsupial]] mammals, and many reptiles and birds, all existing as giant forms until recently. [[Indigenous Australians|Humans]] arrived on the continent very early, about 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The extent human arrival contributed is controversial; climatic drying of Australia 40,000–60,000 years ago was an unlikely cause, as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna.

There has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of [[megafauna]] at the end of the last [[glacial period]] can be attributed to human activities by hunting, or even by slaughter&lt;ref&gt;This may refer to groups of animals endangered by climate change. For example, during a catastrophic drought, remaining animals would be gathered around the few remaining watering holes, and thus become extremely vulnerable.&lt;/ref&gt; of prey populations. Discoveries at Monte Verde in South America and at [[Meadowcroft Rock Shelter]] in Pennsylvania have caused a controversy&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Early Settlement of North America. The Clovis Era. Gary Haynes 2002 {{ISBN|9780521524636}}. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the [[Clovis culture]]. There likely would have been human settlements prior to the Clovis Culture, and the history of [[Settlement of the Americas|humans in the Americas]] may extend back many thousands of years before the Clovis culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated: for example, in [[Wrangel Island]] in Siberia the extinction of dwarf [[woolly mammoth]]s (approximately 2000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = P.S. | year = 1995 | title = Mammoth Extinction: Two Continents and Wrangel Island | url = | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1017/s0033822200014739}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not coincide with the arrival of humans, nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the South American continent, although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions (approximately since the [[industrial revolution]]) and the Pleistocene extinction near the end of the last [[glacial period]]. The latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the [[woolly mammoth]] and the carnivores that preyed on them. Humans of this era actively hunted the [[mammoth]] and the [[mastodon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitulko | first1 = V. V. | last2 = Nikolsky | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Girya | first3 = E.

E. 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;link.springer.com&quot;/&gt;

The ecosystems encountered by the first Americans had not been exposed to human interaction, and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans. Therefore, the actions of the Clovis people, despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

====Afroeurasia====
{{See also|List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|List of extinct animals of Europe}}
Africa experienced the smallest decline in megafauna compared to the other continents.

====Megafaunal extinction====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolf2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C.

Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = &quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=D.

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith&quot;/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2–4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith&quot;/&gt;

=== Disease ===

The hyperdisease hypothesis, proposed by Ross MacPhee in 1997, states that the megafaunal die-off was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal humans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacPhee&amp;Marx1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 |chapter= Humans, hyperdisease and first-contact extinctions |title=Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar |editor= Goodman, S. |editor2=Patterson, B.D. | location = Washington D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian Press | pages = 169–217 | isbn = 1-56098-683-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacPhee&amp;Marx1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Lightning Strikes Twice: Blitzkrieg, Hyperdisease, and Global Explanations of the Late Quaternary Catastrophic Extinctions | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | url = http://www.amnh.biz/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day1/bytes/MacPheePres.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first = Ross D.E.| last = MacPhee|author2=Preston Marx | title = The 40,000-year Plague: Humans, Hyperdisease, and First-Contact Extinctions| booktitle = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar| pages = 169–217| publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press| year = 1997| location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacPhee, aboriginals or animals travelling with them, such as [[domestic dog]]s or livestock, introduced one or more highly [[virulent]] diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to them, eventually leading to their extinction. [[K-selection]] animals, such as the now-extinct megafauna, are especially vulnerable to diseases, as opposed to [[r-selection]] animals who have a shorter [[gestation period]] and a higher population size. Humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacPhee&amp;Marx1997&quot;/&gt;

There are many problems with this theory in the scientific community, as this disease would have to meet several criteria: it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no [[host (biology)|hosts]]; it has to have a high [[infection rate]]; and be extremely lethal, with a [[mortality rate]] of 50–75%. Disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a [[genus]] or [[species]], and even such a virulent disease as [[West Nile Virus]] is unlikely to have caused extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons et al2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lyons|first=K.|last2=Smith|first2=F.

Rising levels of carbon dioxide are resulting in influx of this gas into the ocean, increasing its acidity. Marine organisms which possess Calcium Carbonate shells or exoskeletons experience physiological pressure as the carbonate reacts with acid. This is already resulting in [[coral bleaching]] on various [[coral reef]]s worldwide, which provide valuable habitat for very high biodiversity. Marine gastropods, bivalves and other invertebrates are also affected, as are any organisms that feed on them.

Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more [[Plastic pollution|plastic]] than fish in the oceans by weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/world/sutter-vanishing-help/|title=How to stop the sixth mass extinction |first=John D. |last=Sutter |date=December 12, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R.; Angulo, A.|downloaded=11 January 2017|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Decline in amphibian populations|decline of amphibian populations]] has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation. As well as habitat loss, introduced predators and pollution, [[Chytridiomycosis]], a fungal infection thought to have been accidentally spread by human travel,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; has caused severe population drops of several species of frogs, including (among many others) the extinction of the [[golden toad]] in Costa Rica and the [[Gastric-brooding frog]] in Australia. Many other amphibian species now face extinction, including the reduction of [[Rabb's Fringe-limbed Treefrog|Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog]] to an [[endling]], and the extinction of the [[Panamanian golden frog]] in the wild. Chytrid fungus has spread across Australia, New Zealand, Central America and Africa, including countries with high amphibian diversity such as [[cloud forest]]s in [[Honduras]] and [[Madagascar]]. ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans]]'' is a similar infection currently threatening [[salamander]]s. Amphibians are now the most endangered vertebrate group, having existed for more than 300 million years through three other [[mass extinction]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Millions of bats in the US have been dying off since 2012 due to a fungal infection spread from European bats, which appear to be immune. Population drops have been as great as 90% within five years, and extinction of at least one bat species is predicted. There is currently no form of treatment, and such declines have been described as &quot;unprecedented&quot; in bat evolutionary history by Alan Hicks of the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

'''Hollywood-style Lindy Hop''' is a variety of [[Lindy Hop]], an [[United States|America]]n vernacular [[dance]]. It is also sometimes referred to as Dean Collins or Smooth-style, but these terms also sometimes refer to different styles of Lindy Hop.

Hollywood is the style reconstructed by Erik Robison and Sylvia Skylar based on movies from 1930s and 1940s featuring dancers like [[Dean Collins (dancer)|Dean Collins]], [[Jewel McGowan]], [[Jean Veloz]] and others.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}. They were the first to call it &quot;Hollywood Style&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[swingout]] (the basic step of Lindy) is danced in a position often described as someone about to sit on a stool, thereby bringing their center point of balance closer to the ground.  This piked position is the classic look of Hollywood with the back straight and a slight forward tilt.  The Hollywood style is also a [[slotted dance]], meaning the follower travels in a straight line instead of the more elliptical or circular [[Savoy-style Lindy Hop]].

A popular variation of Hollywood-Style Lindy Hop called '''LA-style Lindy Hop''' has a few technical changes in the [[footwork (dance)|footwork]] and fewer steps. The steps are shortened or &quot;cheated&quot; to create this look. The style is geared towards performance and is heavily based on short choreographies. Originating in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], LA-style is a favorite on the [[West Coast of the United States]].

The '''Harrison Narcotics Tax Act''' (Ch. 1, {{USStat|38|785}}) was a [[United States federal law]] that regulated and taxed the production, importation, and distribution of [[opiates]] and [[coca]] products. The act was proposed by [[United States Representative|Representative]] [[Francis Burton Harrison]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and was approved on December 17, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;

&quot;An Act To provide for the registration of, with collectors of internal revenue, and to impose a special tax on all persons who produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away [[opium]] or [[coca]] leaves, their salts, derivatives, or preparations, and for other purposes.&quot; The courts interpreted this to mean that physicians could prescribe narcotics to patients in the course of normal treatment, but not for the treatment of addiction.

The Harrison Anti-Narcotic [[legislation]] consisted of three [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] bills imposing restrictions on the availability and consumption of the [[psychoactive drug]] [[opium]]. U.S. House bills {{USBill|63|H.R.|1966}} and {{USBill|63|H.R.|1967}} passed conjointly with House bill {{USBill|63|H.R.|6282}} or the Opium and Coca Leaves Trade Restrictions Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/63/publaw-46.pdf |title=Opium Importation Amendment - P.L. 63-46 |work=38 Stat. 275 |series={{USBill|63|H.R.|1966}} |publisher=Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/63/publaw-47.pdf |title=Opium Manufacture Restrictions - P.L. 63-47 |work=38 Stat. 277 |series={{USBill|63|H.R.|1967}} |publisher=Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although technically illegal for purposes of distribution and use, the distribution, sale and use of [[cocaine]] was still legal for registered companies and individuals.

== History ==

=== International background ===
Following the [[Spanish–American War]] the U.S. acquired the [[Philippines]] from Spain. At that time, opium addiction constituted a significant problem in the civilian population of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Escohotado |first=Antônio |title=Historia General de las Drogas |trans-title=General History of Drugs |edition=&lt;!--Alianza--&gt;Alliance |year=1998 |pages=610–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Henry Brent]] was an American Episcopal bishop who served as Missionary Bishop of the Philippines beginning in 1901. He convened a Commission of Inquiry, known as the [[Brent Commission]], for the purpose of examining alternatives to a licensing system for opium addicts. The Commission recommended that narcotics should be subject to international control. The recommendations of the Brent Commission were endorsed by the [[United States Department of State]] and in 1906 President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] called for an international conference, the [[International Opium Commission]], which was held in Shanghai in February 1909. A second conference was held at [[The Hague]] in May 1911, and out of it came the first international drug control treaty, the [[International Opium Convention]] of 1912.

=== Domestic Background ===
In the 1800s opiates and cocaine were mostly unregulated drugs. In the 1890s the [[Sears &amp; Roebuck]] catalogue, which was distributed to millions of Americans homes, offered a syringe and a small amount of cocaine for $1.50.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot; /&gt;  On the other hand, as early as 1880 some states and localities had already passed laws against smoking opium, at least in public.&lt;ref&gt;See for example this [http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH18790118.2.11&amp;srpos=3&amp;e=--1866---1900--en--20-LAH%2cLASTAR-1-byDA-txt-txIN-smoking+opium-------1 article] in the Los Angeles Herald, mentioning the city law against opium smoking. LAH. ''Local Brevities''. 19 January 1879 p3&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, cocaine began to be linked to crime. In 1900, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' published an editorial stating, &quot;Negroes in the South are reported as being addicted to a new form of vice – that of 'cocaine sniffing' or the 'coke habit.'&quot;  Some newspapers later claimed cocaine use caused blacks to rape white women and was improving their pistol marksmanship&lt;ref&gt;Meantioned in an 8 February, 1914, New York New York Times article titled &quot;Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are a New Menace.&quot; by Edward Huntington Williams, M.D [http://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/download/5410/4605]&lt;/ref&gt;. Chinese immigrants were blamed for importing the opium-smoking habit to the U.S. The 1903 blue-ribbon citizens' panel, the Committee on the Acquirement of the Drug Habit, concluded, &quot;If the Chinaman cannot get along without his dope we can get along without him.&quot;

[[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed Dr. [[Hamilton Wright]] as the first Opium Commissioner of the United States in 1908. In 1909, Wright attended the International Opium Commission in Shanghai as the American delegates. He was accompanied by Charles Henry Brent, the Episcopal Bishop. On March 12, 1911, Dr. Wright was quoted in as follows in an article in the New York Times: &quot;Of all the nations of the world, the United States consumes most habit-forming drugs per capita. Opium, the most pernicious drug known to humanity, is surrounded, in this country, with far fewer safeguards than any other nation in Europe fences it with.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hamilton&quot; /&gt; Wright further claimed that &quot;it has been authoritatively stated that cocaine is often the direct incentive to the crime of rape by the negroes of the South and other sections of the country,&quot; though he failed to mention specifically ''which'' authorities had stated that, and did not provide any evidence for his claim.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Hamilton. ''Report of the International Opium Commission, Shanghai, China, February 1 to February 26, 1909''. Rep. Shanghai: North-China Daily News &amp; Herald, 1909. Archive.org, 17 Mar. 2010. Web. 17 Aug. 2014. &lt;https://archive.org/details/cu31924032583225&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright also stated that &quot;one of the most unfortunate phases of smoking opium in this country is the large number of women who have become involved and were living as common-law wives or cohabitating with Chinese in the Chinatowns of our various cities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cora&quot;&gt;

Southern sheriffs believed cocaine even rendered blacks impervious to .32-cal. bullets (as a result many police departments switched to .38-cal.).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Opium usage had begun to decline by 1914 after rising dramatically in the post Civil War Era, peaking at around one-half million pounds per year in 1896.&lt;ref  name=&quot;Musto&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Several authors have argued that the debate was merely to regulate trade and collect a tax. However, the committee report&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;&gt;Committee on Finance (Ways and Means Committee, Senate Reports, vol. 1, of the 63rd Congress, 2nd session on Senate Bill 6552, report #258, pp. 3-4)&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the debate on the house floor and the debate itself, discussed the rise of opiate use in the United States.  Harrison stated that &quot;The purpose of this Bill can hardly be said to raise revenue, because it prohibits the importation of something upon which we have hitherto collected revenue.&quot; Later Harrison stated, &quot;We are not attempting to collect revenue, but regulate commerce.&quot;   House representative [[Thomas Sisson]] stated, &quot;The purpose of this bill—and we are all in sympathy with it—is to prevent the use of opium in the United States, destructive as it is to human happiness and human life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rat&quot;&gt;

Before the Act was passed, on February 8, 1914, The ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article entitled &quot;Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are New Southern Menace: Murder and Insanity Increasing Among Lower-Class Blacks&quot; by Edward Huntington Williams, which reported that Southern sheriffs had increased the caliber of their weapons from .32 to .38 to bring down Negroes under the effect of cocaine.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot; /&gt;

Despite the extreme racialization of the issue that took place in the buildup to the Act's passage, the contemporary research on the subject indicated that black Americans were in fact using cocaine and opium at much ''lower'' rates than white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer, John, and Thomas Vietorisz. ''[https://libcom.org/library/2-blacks-cocaine-opium-1905-1920 Drug Use, the Labor Market and Class Conflict]''. Washington: Drug Abuse Council, 1974. Libcom.org. Web. 17 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect ===

Enforcement began in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enforcement.lawin.org/drug-enforcement-administration Drug Enforcement Administration | Enforcement | Encyclopedia of Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

The act appears to be concerned about the marketing of opiates. However a clause applying to doctors allowed distribution &quot;in the course of his professional practice only.&quot; This clause was interpreted after 1917 to mean that a doctor could not prescribe opiates to an addict, since addiction was not considered a disease. A number of doctors were arrested and some were imprisoned. The medical profession quickly learned not to supply opiates to addicts. In ''United States v. Doremus'', 249 U.S. 86 (1919), the Supreme Court ruled that the Harrison Act was constitutional, and in ''[[Webb v. United States]]'', 249 U.S. 96, 99 (1919) that physicians could not prescribe narcotics solely for maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;kand&quot; /&gt;

The impact of diminished supply was obvious by mid-1915. A 1918 commission called for sterner law enforcement, while newspapers published sensational articles about addiction-related crime waves.&lt;ref&gt;Albert F. Nathan. &quot;Drug Fiends Make 'Crime Wave.'&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'' (1886–1922). Los Angeles, Calif.: Nov 30, 1919. p. II1 (2 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded by tightening up the Harrison Act—the importation of [[heroin]] for any purpose was banned in 1924.

After other complementary laws (for example implementing the Uniform State Narcotic Act in 1932), and other actions by the government the number of addicts of opium started to decrease fast from 1925 to a level that in 1945 that was about one tenth of the level in 1914.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The use of the term '[[narcotic]]s' in the title of the act to describe not just opiates but also [[cocaine]]—which is a central nervous system stimulant, not a narcotic—initiated a precedent of frequent legislative and judicial misclassification of various substances as 'narcotics'. Today, law enforcement agencies, popular media, the [[United Nations]], other nations and even some medical practitioners can be observed applying the term very broadly and often pejoratively in reference to a wide range of illicit substances, regardless of the more precise definition existing in medical contexts. For this reason, however, 'narcotic' has come to mean any illegally used drug, but it is useful as a shorthand for referring to a controlled drug in a context where its legal status is more important than its physiological effects.

The remaining effect of this act, which has largely been superseded by the [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]], is the warning &quot;*Warning: May be habit forming&quot; on labels, package inserts, and other places where ingredients are listed in the case of many [[opioids]], [[barbiturates]], medicinal formulations of [[cocaine]], and [[chloral hydrate]].

The act also marks the beginning of the creation of the modern, criminal drug addict and the American [[black market]] for drugs. Within five years the Rainey Committee, a Special Committee on Investigation appointed by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] and led by Congressman T. Rainey, reported in June, 1919&lt;ref name=pharmaceutical53&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmaceuticaler53newyuoft |title=The Pharmaceutical era, vol 53 |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that drugs were being smuggled into the country by sea, and across the Mexican and Canadian borders by nationally established organisations&lt;ref&gt;[http://adh.2.forumer.com/a/america-in-the-19th-century_post470.html The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs] Edward M. Brecher and the Editors of ''Consumer Reports'' Magazine, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and that the United States consumed 470,000 pounds of opium annually, compared to 17,000 pounds in both France and Germany.&lt;ref name=pharmaceutical53 /&gt; The Monthly Summary of Foreign Commerce of the United States recorded that in the 7 months to January 1920, 528,635 pounds of opium was imported, compared to 74,650 pounds in the same period in 1919.&lt;ref name=pharmaceutical53 /&gt;

== Challenge ==
The Act's applicability in prosecuting [[physician|doctors]] who prescribe narcotics to [[Substance dependence|addicts]] was successfully challenged in ''[[Linder v. United States]]'' in 1925, as [[Justice McReynolds]] ruled that the federal government has no power to regulate medical practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|Horse equipment||Equipment (disambiguation)}}
'''Tack''' is a piece of equipment or accessory equipped on [[horse]]s in the course of their use as [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] [[animal]]s. Saddles, stirrups, bridles, halters, reins, [[Bit (horse)|bits]], harnesses, [[Martingale (tack)|martingales]], and breastplates are all forms of horse tack. Equipping a horse is often referred to as '''tacking up'''. A room to store such equipment, usually near or in a [[stable]], is a '''tack room'''.

== Saddles ==
{{main|Saddle}}
[[Image:mounted-police.jpg|thumb|A horse equipped with a saddle for mounted police.]]
Saddles  are seats for the [[horseback riding|rider]], fastened to the horse's [[Back (horse)|back]] by means of a ''[[Girth (tack)|girth]]'' (English-style riding), known as a ''cinch'' in the Western US, a wide [[strap]] that goes around the horse at a point about four inches behind the forelegs. Some western saddles will also have a second strap known as a ''flank'' or ''back cinch'' that fastens at the rear of the saddle and goes around the widest part of the horse's belly.&lt;ref name=Catalog167&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 167-178&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that the saddle be comfortable for both the rider and the horse as an improperly fitting saddle may create pressure points on the horse's back muscle ([[Latissimus dorsi]]) and cause the horse pain and can lead to the horse, rider, or both getting injured.

There are many types of saddle, each specially designed for its given task.
Saddles are usually divided into two major categories: &quot;[[English saddle]]s&quot; and &quot;[[Western saddle]]s&quot; according to the riding discipline they are used in. Other types of saddles, such as [[Horse racing|racing]] saddles, [[Australian Stock Saddle|Australian saddle]]s, [[sidesaddle]]s and [[Endurance riding|endurance]] saddles do not necessarily fit neatly in either category.&lt;ref name=Catalog167/&gt;

===Saddle accessories===
*[[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplate]] or breastcollar:  Prevents saddles of all styles from sliding sideways or backward on a horse's back
*[[Surcingle]]
*[[Crupper]]
*[[Horse harness|Breeching]], also called &quot;britching&quot;
*[[Saddle blanket]] or numnah

=== Stirrups ===
{{main|Stirrup}}
[[Stirrup]]s are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle. They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.  If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away.  To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions are taken.  First, most riders wear [[riding boot]]s with a heel and a smooth sole. Next, some saddles, particularly [[English saddle]]s, have safety bars that allow a [[Stirrup#Stirrup leathers|stirrup leather]] to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.  Other precautions are done with stirrup design itself.  [[Western saddle]]s have wide stirrup treads that make it more difficult for the foot to become trapped.  A number of saddle styles incorporate a [[tapedero]], which is  covering over the front of the stirrup that keeps the foot from sliding all the way through the stirrup.  The English stirrup (or &quot;iron&quot;) has several design variations which are either shaped to allow the rider's foot to slip out easily or are closed with a very heavy rubber band.&lt;ref name=Catalog185&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 185-187&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention of stirrups was of great historic significance in [[horses in warfare|mounted combat]], giving the rider secure foot support while on horseback.

==Headgear==
[[Image:Horse Wearing Navy Blue Nylon Halter.jpg|thumb|right|A nylon halter/headcollar]]

''[[Bridle]]s'', [[hackamore]]s, ''[[halter]]s'' or ''headcollars'', and similar equipment consist of various arrangements of straps around the horse's head, and are used for control and [[animal communication|communication]] with the animal.

===Halters===
{{main|halter}}

A ''[[halter]]'' (US) or ''headcollar'' (UK) (occasionally ''headstall'') consists of a noseband and headstall that buckles around the horse's head and allows the horse to be led or tied.  The lead rope is separate, and it may be short (from six to ten feet, two to three meters) for everyday leading and tying, or much longer (up to {{convert|25|ft|m}}, eight meters) for tasks such as for leading [[packhorse]]s or for picketing a horse out to graze.

Some horses, particularly [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]]s, may have a chain attached to the lead rope and placed over the nose or under the jaw to increase the control provided by a halter while being led.  Most of the time, horses are not ridden with a halter, as it offers insufficient precision and control.  Halters have no bit.&lt;ref name=Ensg384&gt;Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses &amp; Tack: A Complete One Volume Reference on Horses and Their Care'' Rev. ed. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. 1991 {{ISBN|0-395-54413-0}} p. 384-385&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australian and British English, a ''halter'' is a rope with a spliced running loop around the nose and another over the poll, used mainly for unbroken horses or for [[cattle]].  The lead rope cannot be removed from the halter. A show halter is made from rolled leather and the lead attaches to form the chinpiece of the noseband. These halters are not suitable for paddock usage or in loose stalls.  An ''underhalter'' is a lightweight halter or headcollar which is made with only one small buckle, and can be worn under a bridle for tethering a horse without untacking.

===Bridles===
{{Main|Bridle}}
Bridles usually have a ''[[bit (horse)|bit]]'' attached to ''reins'' and are used for [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[Driving (horse)|driving]] horses.&lt;ref name=Catalog156&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chestnut Horse With Loose Ring Snaffle Bit.png|thumb|left|An English bridle with cavesson noseband]]

''English Bridles'' have a ''[[caveson|cavesson]]'' style [[noseband]] and are seen in [[English riding]].  Their reins are buckled to one another, and they have little adornment or flashy hardware.&lt;ref name=Catalog156/&gt;

''Western Bridles'' used in [[Western riding]] usually have no [[noseband]], are made of thin bridle leather.  They may have long, separated &quot;Split&quot; reins or shorter closed reins, which sometimes include an attached ''[[Romal]]''.  Western bridles are often adorned with silver or other decorative features.&lt;ref name=Catalog156/&gt;

''[[Double bridle]]s'' are a type of English bridle that use two bits in the mouth at once, a snaffle and a curb. The two bits allow the rider to have very precise control of the horse.  As a rule, only very advanced horses and riders use double bridles. Double bridles are usually seen in the top levels of [[dressage]], but also are seen in certain types of show hack and [[Saddle seat]] competition.&lt;ref name=Catalog158/&gt;

===Hackamores and other bitless designs===
[[Image:BosalHorse.jpg|thumb|A bosal hackamore]]
{{Main|Hackamore|Bitless bridle}}
A ''[[hackamore]]'' is a headgear that utilizes a heavy [[noseband]] of some sort, rather than a bit, most often used to train young horses or to go easy on an older horse's mouth.  Hackamores are more often seen in [[western riding]].&lt;ref name=Catalog158&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;  Some related styles of headgear  that control a horse with a noseband rather than a bit are known as [[bitless bridle]]s.

The word &quot;[[hackamore]]&quot; is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''jáquima.''  Hackamores are seen in [[western riding]] disciplines, as well as in [[endurance riding]] and [[English riding]] disciplines such as [[show jumping]] and the stadium phase of [[eventing]].  While the classic [[bosal]]-style hackamore is usually used to start young horses, other designs, such as various [[bitless bridle]]s and the [[mechanical hackamore]] are often seen on mature horses with dental issues that make bit use painful, horses with certain training problems, and on horses with mouth or tongue injuries.  Some riders also like to use them in the winter to avoid putting a frozen metal bit into a horse's mouth.&lt;ref name=Catalog153&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Like bitted bridles, noseband-based designs can be gentle or harsh, depending on the hands of the rider. It is a myth that a bit is cruel and a hackamore is gentler. The horse's face is very soft and sensitive with many nerve endings.  Misuse of a hackamore can cause swelling on the nose, scraping on the nose and jawbone, and extreme misuse may cause damage to the bones and [[cartilage]] of the horse's head.

===Other headgear===
A ''[[longeing cavesson]]'' (UK: ''lungeing'') is a special type of halter or noseband used for [[longeing]] a horse. Longeing is the activity of having a horse walk, trot and/or canter in a large circle around the handler at the end of a rope that is 25 to {{convert|30|ft|m}} long. It is used for training and exercise.&lt;ref name=Catalog194&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reins ==
{{main|Rein}}
[[Reins]] consist of leather straps or rope attached to the outer ends of a ''bit'' and extend to the rider's or driver's hands. Reins are the means by which a horse rider or driver [[animal communication|communicates]] directional commands to the horse's head. Pulling on the reins can be used to steer or stop the horse. The sides of a horse's mouth are sensitive, so pulling on the reins pulls the bit, which then pulls the horse's head from side to side, which is how the horse is controlled.&lt;ref name=Catalog159&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 159-161&lt;/ref&gt;

On some types of [[Horse harness|harness]]es there might be supporting rings to carry the reins over the horse's back. When pairs of horses are used in drawing a [[wagon]] or [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] it is usual for the outer side of each pair to be connected to reins and the inside of the bits connected by a short bridging strap or rope. The driver carries &quot;four-in-hand&quot; or &quot;six-in-hand&quot; being the number of reins connecting to the pairs of horses.

A rein may be attached to a halter to lead or guide the horse in a circle for training purposes or to lead a packhorse, but a simple lead rope is more often used for these purposes.  A [[longeing|longe line]] is sometimes called a &quot;longe rein,&quot; but it is actually a flat line about {{convert|30|ft|m}} long, usually made of nylon or cotton web, about one inch wide, thus longer and wider than even a driving rein.&lt;ref name=Ensg385&gt;Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses &amp; Tack: A Complete One Volume Reference on Horses and Their Care'' Rev. ed. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. 1991 {{ISBN|0-395-54413-0}} p. 385-386&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses should never be tied by the reins.  Not only do they break easily, but, being attached to a bit in the horse's sensitive mouth, a great deal of pain can be inflicted if a bridled horse sets back against being tied.

==Bits==
{{Main|Bit (horse)}}
[[Image:Pelham bit.jpg|thumb|A pelham bit with a jointed mouthpiece]]
A [[Bit (horse)|bit]] is a device placed in a horse's mouth, kept on a horse's head by means of a headstall. There are many types, each useful for specific types of riding and training.&lt;ref name=Ensg371&gt;Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses &amp; Tack: A Complete One Volume Reference on Horses and Their Care'' Rev. ed. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. 1991 {{ISBN|0-395-54413-0}} p. 371-376&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouthpiece of the bit does not rest on the [[horse teeth|teeth of the horse]], but rather rests on the gums or &quot;bars&quot; of the horse's mouth in an interdental space behind the front [[incisors]] and in front of the back [[molars]].  It is important that the style of bit is appropriate to the horse's needs and is fitted properly for it to function properly and be as comfortable as possible for the horse.&lt;ref name=Catalog149&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 149-159&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Curb and bradoon.jpg|thumb|left|a curb and snaffle bit shown together on a double bridle]]
The basic &quot;classic&quot; styles of [[Bit (horse)|bits]] are:
*[[Curb bit]]
*[[Snaffle bit]]
*[[Pelham bit]]
*[[Double bridle|Weymouth or Double Bridle]]

While there are literally hundreds of types of [[bit mouthpiece]]s, [[bit ring]]s and [[bit shank]]s, essentially there are really only two broad categories: direct pressure bits, broadly termed [[snaffle bit]]s; and leverage bits, usually termed [[curb bit|curbs]].

Bits that act with direct pressure on the tongue and lips of the bit are in the general category of ''snaffle'' bits. Snaffle bits commonly have a single jointed mouthpiece and act with a nutcracker effect on the bars, tongue and occasionally roof of the mouth.  However, regardless of [[bit mouthpiece|mouthpiece]], any bit that operates only on direct pressure is a &quot;snaffle&quot; bit.&lt;ref name=Complete52&gt;Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David &amp; Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 52-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Leverage bits have [[bit shank|shanks]] coming off the mouthpiece to create leverage that applies pressure to the [[poll (livestock)|poll]], chin groove and mouth of the horse are in the category of ''curb'' bits. Any bit with shanks that works off of leverage is a &quot;curb&quot; bit, regardless of whether the [[bit mouthpiece|mouthpiece]] is solid or jointed.

Some [[bit (horse)|combination or hybrid bits]] combine direct pressure and leverage, such as the [[Kimberwicke|Kimblewick or Kimberwicke]], which adds slight leverage to a two-rein design that resembles a snaffle;&lt;ref name=Complete91&gt;Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David &amp; Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 91-93&lt;/ref&gt; and the four rein designs such as the single mouthpiece [[Pelham bit]] and the [[double bridle]], which places a curb and a snaffle bit simultaneously in the horse's mouth.&lt;ref name=Complete87&gt;Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David &amp; Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wrong hands even the mildest bit can hurt the horse. Conversely, a very severe bit, in the right hands, can transmit subtle commands that cause no pain to the horse. Bit commands should be given with only the quietest [[riding aids|movements]] of the hands, and much steering and stopping should be done with the legs and seat.

== Harness ==
{{Main|Horse harness}}
A [[horse harness]] is a set of devices and straps that attaches a horse to a [[cart]], [[carriage]], [[sledge]] or any other load.  There are two main styles of harnesses - [[breaststrap]] and [[Horse collar|collar and hames]] style.  These differ in how the weight of the load is attached.  Most Harnesses are made from leather, which is the traditional material for harnesses, though some designs are now made of nylon webbing or synthetic biothane.

A breaststrap harness has a wide leather strap going horizontally across the horses' breast, attached to the [[trace (tack)|traces]] and then to the load.  This is used only for lighter loads.  A collar and hames harness has a [[horse collar|collar]] around the horses' neck with wood or metal [[horse collar|hames]] in the collar. The traces attach from the hames to the load.  This type of harness is needed for [[Draft horse|heavy draft]] work.

Both types will also have a [[bridle]] and [[rein]]s.  A harness that is used to support shafts, such as on a cart pulled by a single horse, will also have a ''saddle'' attached to the harness to help the horse support the shafts and ''breeching'' to brake the forward motion of the vehicle, especially when stopping or moving downhill. Horses guiding vehicles by means of a pole, such as two-horse teams pulling a [[wagon]], a hay-mower, or a [[Wagon|dray]], will have ''pole-straps'' attached to the lower part of the horse collar.

==Breastplates and martingales==
[[Image:Elastic Jumper Breastplate.jpg|thumb|An English-style breastplate with elastic and a running martingale attachment]]
{{main|Breastplate (tack)|Martingale (tack)}}
[[Image:Pc trakehner2.jpg|thumb|left|Horse wearing a breastplate]]

[[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]], breastcollars or breastgirths attach to the front of the saddle, cross the horse's chest, and usually have a strap that runs between the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth.  They  keep the saddle from sliding back or sideways. They are usually seen in demanding, fast-paced sports.  They are crucial pieces of safety equipment for [[English riding]] activities requiring jumping, such as [[eventing]], [[show jumping]], [[polo]], and [[fox hunting]].  They are also seen in [[Western riding]] events, particularly in [[rodeo]], [[reining]] and [[cutting (sport)|cutting]], where it is particularly important to prevent a saddle from shifting.  They may also be worn in other [[horse show]] classes for decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=Catalog179&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 179-181&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Martingale (tack)|martingale]] is a piece of equipment that keeps a horse from raising its head too high.  Various styles can be used as a control measure, to prevent the horse from avoiding rider commands by raising its head out of position; or as a safety measure to keep the horse from tossing its head high or hard enough to smack its rider in the face.&lt;ref name=Catalog163&gt;Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt;

They are allowed in many types of competition, especially those where speed or jumping may be required, but are not allowed in most &quot;flat&quot; classes at [[horse show]]s, though an exception is made in a few classes limited exclusively to young or &quot;green&quot; horses who may not yet be fully trained.

Martingales are usually attached to the horse one of two ways.  They are either attached to the center chest ring of a breastplate or, if no breastplate is worn, they are attached by two straps, one that goes around the horse's neck, and the other that attaches to the girth, with the martingale itself beginning at the point in the center of the chest where the neck and girth straps intersect.

Martingale types include:

*German martingale or Market Harborough: This design consists of a split fork that comes up from the chest, runs through the rings of the bit and attaches to the reins of the bridle between the bit and the rider's hand.  It acts in a manner similar to a running martingale, but with greater leverage.  It is not usually considered show legal and is used primarily as a training aid.
*Irish martingale: Unlike the previous designs, this very simple &quot;martingale&quot; does not control the height of the horse's head, but merely keeps the reins from going over the horse's head in the result of a fall. It consists of a piece of leather with a ring on each end through which each rein runs.&lt;ref name=Complete133&gt;Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David &amp; Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Baltic Cup Shannon Mejnert Sandy2.jpg|thumb|left|a horse wearing a running martingale]]
*Running martingale: This design adds leverage to a [[horse bit|bit]] and features a split ''fork'' beginning at the chest with a ring on each side of the fork through which the reins pass, enabling the rider to more easily keep the horse under control, but also allowing the horse freedom of movement when needed.  Fitted correctly, the running martingale only controls how high the horse carries its head when the rider tightens the reins.  The standard adjustment of a running martingale is to set the rings at a height where they do not engage and add leverage to the reins when the horse carries its head at the proper height.  Sometimes a running martingale may be adjusted at a greater or lesser length depending on the needs of the horse and rider.&lt;ref name=Catalog163/&gt;
*Standing martingale: A design with one strap that runs from the girth or the chest and attaches to the [[noseband]] of the bridle. The standing martingale acts on the horse's nose and creates an absolute limit to how high a horse can raise its head.  The term used in [[western riding]] for this piece of equipment is the ''tie down''.  Standard adjustment of a standing martingale allows enough slack to bring the strap to the horse's [[horse anatomy|throatlatch]] when the animal has its head in a relaxed, natural position.  However, it is sometimes adjusted shorter.  Unlike the running martingale, it limits the freedom of the horse's head, no matter how long or short the reins may be.  While standing martingales are common in [[show hunter]] and [[equitation]] classes, the limits placed on the horse's movement are dangerous for [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]] riding or [[show jumping]]. Therefore, in these disciplines, a running martingale is necessary for safety reasons, if a martingale is used at all.&lt;ref name=Catalog163/&gt;

There are other training devices that fall loosely in the martingale category, in that they use straps attached to the reins or bit which limit the movement of the horse's head or add leverage to the rider's hands in order to control the horse's head. Common devices of this nature include the [[bearing rein|overcheck]], the [[chambon]], [[gogue|de Gogue]], grazing reins, [[draw reins and running reins|draw reins]] and the &quot;bitting harness&quot; or &quot;[[bitting rig]]&quot;. However, most of this equipment is used for training purposes and is not legal in any competition.  In some disciplines, use of leverage devices, even in training, is controversial.

'''Hausa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|s|ə}}){{sfnp|Bauer|2007|p=?}} (''Yaren Hausa'' or ''Harshen Hausa'') is the [[Chadic languages|Chadic language]] (a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]) with the largest number of speakers, spoken as a first language by more than 70&amp;nbsp;million people&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/12/hausa-speakers-nigeria-now-120m-communique/&lt;/ref&gt;, and as a [[second language]] by another 40 to 50 million or more. Originally the language of the [[Hausa people]] stretching across southern [[Niger]] and northern [[Nigeria]], it has developed into a [[lingua&amp;nbsp;franca]] across much of [[Western  Africa]] for purposes of trade. In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has become more commonly published in print and online.

==Classification==
{{Main|Afroasiatic languages}}
Hausa belongs to the [[West Chadic languages]] subgroup of the [[Chadic languages]] group, which in turn is part of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language]] family.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Nigeria linguistic 1979.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The linguistic groups of Nigeria in 1979]]
Native speakers of Hausa, the [[Hausa people]], are mostly found in [[Niger]], in the north of [[Nigeria]], and in [[Chad]]. Furthermore, the language is used as a [[trade language]] across a much larger swathe of West Africa ([[Benin]], [[Ghana]], [[Cameroon]], [[Togo]], [[Ivory Coast]] etc.), [[Central Africa]] ([[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Gabon]]) and in northwestern [[Sudan]], particularly amongst [[Islam|Muslims]].

It is taught at universities in Africa and around the world. The language is the most commonly spoken language in [[Nigeria]] and it is also widely spoken outside Nigeria, especially in Niger, Ghana, Cameroon and Sudan. Radio stations like [[BBC]], [[Radio France Internationale]], [[China Radio International]], [[Voice of Russia]], [[Voice of America]], [[Arewa]] 24 [[Deutsche Welle]], and [[IRIB]] broadcast in Hausa.

===Dialects===

====Traditional dialects====
Eastern Hausa [[dialect]]s include ''Dauranchi'' in [[Daura]], ''Kananci'' in [[Kano]], ''Bausanchi'' in [[Bauchi]], ''Gudduranci'' in [[Katagum]] [[Misau]] and part of [[Borno State|Borno]], and ''Hadejanci'' in [[Hadejiya]].

Western Hausa dialects include ''Sakkwatanci'' in [[Sokoto]], ''Katsinanci'' in [[Katsina]], ''Arewanci'' in [[Gobir]], [[Adar]], [[Kebbi]], and [[Zamfara]], and ''Kurhwayanci'' in [[Kurfey]] in Niger. Katsina is transitional between Eastern and Western dialects.

Northern Hausa dialects include ''[[Arewa]]'' and ''Arawci''.

''Zazzaganci'' in [[Zazzau]] is the major Southern dialect.

The Daura (''Dauranchi'') and Kano (''Kananci'') dialect are the standard.  The [[BBC]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio France Internationale]] and [[Voice of America]] offer Hausa services on their international news web sites using Dauranci and Kananci. In recent language development Zazzaganci took over the innovation of writing and speaking the current Hausa language use.

====Northernmost dialects and loss of tonality====
The western to eastern Hausa dialects of ''Kurhwayanci'', ''Daragaram'' and ''Aderawa'', represent the traditional northernmost limit of native Hausa communities. These are spoken in the northernmost [[sahel]] and mid-[[Sahara]]n regions in west and central [[Niger]] in the [[Tillaberi]], [[Tahoua]], [[Dosso Region|Dosso]], [[Maradi Region|Maradi]], [[Agadez]] and [[Zinder]] regions. While mutually comprehensible with other dialects (especially ''Sakkwatanci'', and to a lesser extent ''Gaananci''), the northernmost dialects have slight grammatical and lexical differences owing to frequent contact with the [[Zarma people|Zarma]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] groups and cultural changes owing to the geographical differences between the grassland and desert zones. These dialects also have the quality of being non-[[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] or [[pitch accent]] dialects.

This link between non-tonality and geographic location is not limited to Hausa alone, but is exhibited in other northern dialects of neighbouring languages; such as the difference within [[Songhay language]] (between the non-tonal northernmost dialects of [[Koyra Chiini]] in [[Timbuktu]] and [[Koyraboro Senni]] in [[Gao]]; and the tonal southern [[Zarma language|Zarma]] dialect, spoken from western [[Niger]] to northern [[Ghana]]), and within the [[Soninke language]] (between the non-tonal northernmost dialects of [[Imraguen language|Imraguen]] and [[Nemadi]] spoken in east-central [[Mauritania]]; and the tonal southern dialects of [[Senegal]], [[Mali]] and the [[sahel]]).

====Ghanaian Hausa dialect====
The [[Ghanaian]] Hausa dialect (''Gaananci''), spoken in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and western [[Ivory Coast]], is a distinct western native Hausa dialect-bloc with adequate linguistic and media resources available. Separate smaller Hausa dialects are spoken by an unknown number of Hausa further west in parts of [[Burkina Faso]], and in the [[Haoussa Foulane]], Badji Haoussa, Guezou Haoussa, and [[Ansongo]] districts of northeastern [[Mali]] (where it is designated as a minority language by the Malian government), but there are very little linguistic resources and research done on these particular dialects at this time.

Gaananci forms a separate group from other Western Hausa dialects, as it now falls outside the contiguous Hausa-dominant area, and is usually identified by the use of ''c'' for ''ky'', and ''j'' for ''gy''. This is attributed to the fact that Ghana's Hausa population descend from [[Hausa-Fulani]] traders settled in the [[Zongo settlements|zongo]] districts of major trade-towns up and down the previous [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]], [[Gonja people|Gonja]] and [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] kingdoms stretching from the [[sahel]] to coastal regions, in particular the cities of [[Tamale]], [[Salaga]], [[Bawku]], [[Bolgatanga]], [[Achimota]], [[Nima, Ghana|Nima]] and [[Kumasi]].

Gaananci exhibits noted inflected influences from [[Zarma language|Zarma]], [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Dyula language|Dyula]] and [[Soninke language|Soninke]], as Ghana is the westernmost area in which the Hausa language is a major lingua-franca; as well as it being the westernmost area both the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Zarma people|Djerma]] ethnic groups inhabit in large numbers. Immediately west from Ghana (in Ivory Coast, Togo, and Burkina Faso), Hausa is abruptly replaced with [[Dioula language|Dioula]]&amp;ndash;[[Bambara language|Bambara]] as the main lingua-franca of what become predominantly [[Manding languages|Mandinka]] areas, and native Hausa populations plummet to a very small urban minority.

Because of this, and the presence of surrounding [[Central Tano languages|Akan]], [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Mande languages]], Gaananci was historically isolated from the other Hausa dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol5num2/bodomo.pdf Njas.helsinki.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this difference, grammatical similarities between ''Sakkwatanci'' and Ghanaian Hausa determine that the dialect, and the origin of the Ghanaian Hausa people themselves, are derived from the northwestern Hausa area surrounding Sokoto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnorema.it/pdf/numero%204/03%20Articolo%201%20Guerini.pdf Ethnorema.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hausa is also widely spoken by non-native [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] Ghanaian Muslims, but differs from Gaananci, and rather has features consistent with non-native Hausa dialects.

====Other native dialects====
Hausa is also spoken various parts of Cameroon and Chad, which combined the mixed dialects of northern Nigeria and Niger. In addition, Arabic has had a great influence in the way Hausa is spoken by the native Hausa speakers in these areas.

====Non-native Hausa====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}

In [[West Africa]], Hausa's use as a [[lingua franca]] has given rise to a non-native pronunciation that differs vastly from native pronunciation by way of key omissions of [[Implosive consonant|implosive]] and [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] consonants present in native Hausa dialects, such as ''ɗ'', ''ɓ'' and ''kʼ/ƙ'', which are pronounced by non-native speakers as ''d'', ''b'' and ''k'' respectively. This creates confusion among non-native and native Hausa speakers, as non-native pronunciation does not distinguish words like ''{{wiktha|daidai}}'' (&quot;correct&quot;) and ''{{wiktha|ɗaiɗai}}'' (&quot;one-by-one&quot;). Another difference between native and non-native Hausa is the omission of [[vowel length]] in words and change in the standard [[tonal languages|tone]] of native Hausa dialects (ranging from native [[Fulani]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] Hausa-speakers omitting tone altogether, to Hausa speakers with [[Gur languages|Gur]] or [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] [[mother tongue]]s using additional tonal structures similar to those used in their native languages). Use of masculine and feminine [[Grammatical gender|gender]] nouns and sentence structure are usually omitted or interchanged, and many native Hausa nouns and verbs are substituted with non-native terms from local languages.

Non-native speakers of Hausa numbered more than 25 million and, in some areas, live close to native Hausa. It has replaced many other languages especially in the north-central and north-eastern part of Nigeria and continues to gain popularity in other parts of Africa as a result of Hausa movies and musics which spread out throughout the region.

{{anchor|Gibanawa}}There are several [[pidgin]] forms of Hausa. [[Barikanchi]] was formerly used in the [[military of Nigeria|colonial army]] of Nigeria. Gibanawa is currently in widespread use in [[Jega, Nigeria|Jega]] in northwestern Nigeria, south of the native Hausa area.&lt;ref&gt;{{E17|gib|Gibanawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Hausa has between 23 and 25 consonant phonemes depending on the speaker.

The three-way contrast between palatalized velars {{IPA|/c ɟ cʼ/}}, plain velars {{IPA|/k ɡ kʼ/}}, and labialized velars {{IPA|/kʷ ɡʷ kʷʼ/}} is found only before long and short {{IPA|/a/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/cʼaːɽa/}} ('grass'), {{IPA|/kʼaːɽaː/}} ('to increase'), {{IPA|/kʷʼaːɽaː/}} ('shea-nuts'). Before front vowels, only palatalized and labialized velars occur, e.g. {{IPA|/ciːʃiː/}} ('jealousy') vs. {{IPA|/kʷiːɓiː/}} ('side of body'). Before rounded vowels, only labialized velars occur, e.g. {{IPA|/kʷoːɽaː/}} ('ringworm').{{sfnp|Schuh|Yalwa|1999|p=91}}

===Glottalic consonants===
Hausa has [[glottalic consonant]]s (implosives and ejectives) at four or five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] (depending on the dialect). They require movement of the glottis during [[pronunciation]] and have a [[staccato]] sound.

They are written with modified versions of Latin letters. They can also be denoted with an [[apostrophe]], either before or after depending on the letter, as shown below.

* ɓ / b', an [[implosive consonant]], {{IPAblink|ɓ}}, sometimes {{IPA|[ʔb]}};
* ɗ / d', an implosive {{IPAblink|ɗ}}, sometimes {{IPA|[dʔ]}};
* ts', an [[ejective consonant]], {{IPA|[tsʼ]}} or {{IPA|[sʼ]}}, according to the dialect;
* ch', an ejective {{IPAblink|tʃʼ}} (does not occur in Kano dialect)
* ƙ / k', an ejective {{IPA|[kʼ]}}; {{IPA|[kʲʼ]}} and {{IPA|[kʷʼ]}} are separate consonants;
* ƴ / 'y is a [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] [[approximant]] with [[creaky voice]], {{IPA|[j̰]}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/course/chapter6/hausa/hausa.html Hausa ejectives and laryngealized consonants]. Sound files hosted by the University of California at Los Angeles, from: Ladefoged, Peter: [http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/index.html A Course in Phonetics. 5th ed.] Thomson/Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; found in only a small number of high-frequency words (e.g. {{IPA|/j̰áːj̰áː/}} &quot;children&quot;, {{IPA|/j̰áː/}} &quot;daughter&quot;). Historically it developed from palatalized {{IPAblink|ɗ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Paul (1937/2000) The Hausa Language: an encyclopedic reference grammar. Yale University Press. p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
[[File:Hausa vowel chart.svg|right|upright=1.13|thumb|Hausa vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Schuh|Yalwa|1999|p=91}}. The short vowels {{IPA|/i, u, a/}} have a much wider range of allophones than what is presented on the chart.]]
Hausa has five phonetic vowel sounds, which can be either short or long, giving a total of 10 [[monophthong]]s. In addition, there are four joint vowels ([[diphthong]]s), giving a total number of 14 vowel phonemes.

; Monophthongs: Short (single) vowels: {{IPA|/i, u, e, o, a/}}. &lt;br&gt; Long vowels: {{IPA|/iː, uː, eː, oː, aː/}}.

In comparison with the long vowels, the short {{IPA|/i, u/}} can be similar in quality to the long vowels, [[mid-centralized]] to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}} or centralized to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɨ}}, {{IPA link|ʉ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Schuh|Yalwa|1999|pp=90–91}}

Medial {{IPA|/i, u/}} can be neutralized to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɨ}} ~ {{IPA link|ʉ}}]}}, with the rounding depending on the environment.{{sfnp|Schuh|Yalwa|1999|p=90}}

Medial {{IPA|/e, o/}} are neutralized with {{IPA|/a/}}.{{sfnp|Schuh|Yalwa|1999|p=90}}

The short {{IPA|/a/}} can be either similar in quality to the long {{IPA|/aː/}}, or it can be as high as {{IPAblink|ə}}, with possible intermediate pronunciations ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɐ}} ~ {{IPA link|ɜ}}]}}).{{sfnp|Schuh|Yalwa|1999|pp=90–91}}

; Diphthongs: {{IPA|/ai, au, iu, ui/}}.

===Tones===
Hausa is a [[tonal language]]. Each of its five [[vowel]]s may have low tone, high tone or falling tone. In standard written Hausa, tone is not marked. In recent linguistic and pedagogical materials, tone is marked by means of diacritics.

: {{big|à è ì ò ù}} – low tone: [[grave accent]] ({{big|`}})

: {{big|â ê î ô û}} – falling tone: [[circumflex]] ({{big|ˆ}})

An [[acute accent]] ({{big|´}}) may be used for high tone, but the usual practice is to leave high tone unmarked.

==Writing systems==

===''Boko'' (Latin)===
Hausa's modern official [[orthography]] is a [[Latin script|Latin-based alphabet]] called ''[[Boko (alphabet)|boko]]'', which was introduced in the 1930s by the British colonial administration.

|}
The letter ''[[ƴ]]'' (y with a right hook) is used only in [[Niger]]; in [[Nigeria]] it is written ''ʼy''.

Tone, vowel length, and the distinction between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/ɽ/}} (which does not exist for all speakers) are not marked in writing. So, for example, {{IPA|/daɡa/}} &quot;from&quot; and {{IPA|/daːɡaː/}} &quot;battle&quot; are both written ''daga''.

===''Ajami'' (Arabic)===
Hausa has also been written in ''[[Ajami script|ajami]]'', an [[Arabic script|Arabic alphabet]], since the early 17th century. There is no standard system of using ''ajami'', and different writers may use letters with different values. Short vowels are written regularly with the help of [[ḥarakāt|vowel mark]]s, which are seldom used in Arabic texts other than the Quran. Many medieval Hausa manuscripts in ''ajami'', similar to the [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]], have been discovered recently; some of them even describe [[constellation]]s and [[Islamic calendars|calendar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Hausa is one of three indigenous languages of Nigeria which has been rendered in [[Hausa Braille|braille]].

At least three other writing systems for Hausa have been proposed or &quot;discovered.&quot; None of these are in active use beyond perhaps some individuals.

The area of study known as the '''history of mathematics''' is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in [[mathematics]] and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the [[History of mathematical notation|mathematical methods and notation of the past]].

Before the [[modern age]] and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. The most ancient mathematical texts available are ''[[Plimpton 322]]'' ([[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] c. 1900 BC),&lt;ref&gt;J. Friberg, &quot;Methods and traditions of Babylonian mathematics. Plimpton 322, Pythagorean triples, and the Babylonian triangle parameter equations&quot;, Historia Mathematica, 8, 1981, pp. 277—318.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]'' ([[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] c. 2000–1800 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E. Neugebauer | title = The Exact Sciences in Antiquity | origyear = 1957 | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-22332-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C}} Chap. IV &quot;Egyptian Mathematics and Astronomy&quot;, pp. 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]]'' (Egyptian c. 1890 BC). All of these texts mention the so-called [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]], seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.

The study of mathematics as a demonstrative discipline begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term &quot;mathematics&quot; from the ancient Greek ''μάθημα'' (''mathema''), meaning &quot;subject of instruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas L. Heath, ''A Manual of Greek Mathematics'', Dover, 1963, p. 1: &quot;In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who first made mathematics a science.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]] and the first use of negative numbers.&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp.140—148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp.428—437&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics through the work of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, &quot;The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero&quot;, Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius.&quot; – Pierre Simon Laplace http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic mathematics]], in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Yushkevich|A.P. Juschkewitsch]], &quot;Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter&quot;, Teubner, Leipzig, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]], which led to further development of mathematics in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].

From ancient times through the [[postclassical age|Middle Ages]], periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an [[exponential growth|increasing pace]] that continues through the present day.

The origins of mathematical thought lie in the concepts of [[number]], [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], and [[Configuration (geometry)|form]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Origins p. 3&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Origins&quot; p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to humans. Such concepts would have been part of everyday life in hunter-gatherer societies. The idea of the &quot;number&quot; concept evolving gradually over time is supported by the existence of languages which preserve the distinction between &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, and &quot;many&quot;, but not of numbers larger than two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Origins p. 3&quot;/&gt;

He also writes that &quot;no attempt has been made to explain why a tally of something should exhibit multiples of two, prime numbers between 10 and 20, and some numbers that are almost multiples of 10.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ishango bone, according to scholar [[Alexander Marshack]], may have influenced the later development of mathematics in Egypt as, like some entries on the Ishango bone, Egyptian arithmetic also made use of multiplication by 2; this however, is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Marshack, A. 1972.

[[Predynastic Egypt]]ians of the 5th millennium BC pictorially represented [[Geometry|geometric]] designs. It has been claimed that [[megalith]]ic monuments in [[England]] and [[Scotland]], dating from the 3rd millennium BC, incorporate geometric ideas such as [[circle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, and [[Pythagorean triple]]s in their design.&lt;ref&gt;Thom, Alexander, and Archie Thom, 1988, &quot;The metrology and geometry of Megalithic Man&quot;, pp 132–151 in C.L.N. Ruggles, ed., ''Records in Stone: Papers in memory of Alexander Thom''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-33381-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the above are disputed however, and the currently oldest undisputed mathematical documents are from Babylonian and dynastic Egyptian sources.

[[Image:Plimpton 322.jpg|thumb|The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.]]
[[Babylonia]]n mathematics refers to any mathematics of the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) from the days of the early [[Sumer]]ians through the [[Hellenistic period]] almost to the dawn of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Babylonian mathematical work comes from two widely separated periods: The first few hundred years of the second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period), and the last few centuries of the first millennium BC ([[Seleucid]] period).&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named Babylonian mathematics due to the central role of [[Babylon]] as a place of study. Later under the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]], Mesopotamia, especially [[Baghdad]], once again became an important center of study for [[Islamic mathematics]].

In contrast to the sparsity of sources in [[Egyptian mathematics]], our knowledge of Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan J. Melville (2003). [http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/3Mill/chronology.html Third Millennium Chronology], ''Third Millennium Mathematics''. [[St. Lawrence University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geometry problem-Sb 13088-IMG 0593-white.jpg|thumb|Geometry problem on a clay tablet belonging to a school for scribes; [[Susa]], first half of the 2nd millennium BCE]]
Babylonian mathematics were written using a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25&quot;/&gt; From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25&quot;/&gt; Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26&quot;/&gt; The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26&quot;/&gt; The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27&quot;/&gt; The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26&quot;/&gt; By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26&quot;/&gt; This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26&quot;/&gt;

Other topics covered by Babylonian mathematics include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation]]s and [[cubic equation]]s, a remarkable achievement for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Mesopotamia&quot; p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness of the difference between exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no explicit statement of the need for [[mathematical proof|proofs]] or logical principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Moskou-papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Image of Problem 14 from the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]]. The problem includes a diagram indicating the dimensions of the truncated pyramid.]]
[[Egypt]]ian mathematics refers to mathematics written in the [[Egyptian language]]. From the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Greek language|Greek]] replaced Egyptian as the written language of [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] scholars. Mathematical study in [[Egypt]] later continued under the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] as part of [[Islamic mathematics]], when [[Arabic]] became the written language of Egyptian scholars.

The most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is the [[Rhind papyrus]] (sometimes also called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of about 2000–1800 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Egypt p. 11&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Egypt&quot; p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions] at MathPages&lt;/ref&gt; including [[composite number|composite]] and [[prime number]]s; [[arithmetic mean|arithmetic]], [[geometric mean|geometric]] and [[harmonic mean]]s; and simplistic understandings of both the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] and [[Perfect number|perfect number theory]] (namely, that of the number 6).&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://mathpages.com/home/rhind.htm --&gt;http://mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions]&lt;/ref&gt; It also shows how to solve first order [[linear equation]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Egyptian_papyri.html Egyptian Papyri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[arithmetic series|arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egypt_algebra.html#areithmetic%20series Egyptian Algebra – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant Egyptian mathematical text is the [[Moscow papyrus]], also from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period, dated to c. 1890 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Egypt p. 19&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Egypt&quot; p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of what are today called ''word problems'' or ''story problems'', which were apparently intended as entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a [[frustum]] (truncated pyramid).

Finally, the [[Berlin Papyrus 6619]] (c. 1800 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a second-order [[algebraic equation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptpapyrus.html#berlin Egyptian Mathematical Papyri – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek ==
{{Main article|Greek mathematics}}
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] are generally credited with the first proof of the theorem.]]
Greek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in the [[Greek language]] from the time of [[Thales of Miletus]] (~600 BC) to the closure of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] in 529 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek mathematics of the period following [[Alexander the Great]] is sometimes called Hellenistic mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Age of Plato and Aristotle&quot; p. 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used [[mathematical rigor]] to [[mathematical proof|prove]] them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bernal, &quot;Animadversions on the Origins of Western Science&quot;, pp. 72–83 in Michael H. Shank, ed., ''The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 2000, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematics is thought to have begun with [[Thales of Miletus]] (c. 624–c.546 BC) and [[Pythagoras of Samos]] (c. 582–c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] and [[Babylonian mathematics]]. According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.

Thales used [[geometry]] to solve problems such as calculating the height of [[pyramids]] and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]]. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Ionia and the Pythagoreans&quot; p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was &quot;All is number&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Ionia and the Pythagoreans&quot; p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term &quot;mathematics&quot;, and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of [[irrational numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R.

[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (408–c.355 BC) developed the [[method of exhaustion]], a precursor of modern [[Integral|integration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Age of Plato and Aristotle&quot; p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of [[incommensurable magnitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Age of Plato and Aristotle&quot; p. 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Age of Plato and Aristotle&quot; p. 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, [[Aristotle]] (384–c.322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Age of Plato and Aristotle&quot; p. 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was the [[Musaeum]] of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Euclid of Alexandria&quot; p. 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that [[Euclid]] (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 119&quot;/&gt; The ''Elements'' introduced [[mathematical rigor]] through the [[axiomatic method]] and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the ''Elements'' were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 104&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Euclid of Alexandria&quot; p. 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}} p. 141: &quot;No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the familiar theorems of [[Euclidean geometry]], the ''Elements'' was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such as [[number theory]], [[algebra]] and [[solid geometry]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 104&quot;/&gt; including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid also [[Euclid#Other works|wrote extensively]] on other subjects, such as [[conic sections]], [[optics]], [[spherical geometry]], and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Euclid of Alexandria&quot; p. 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conic sections 2.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Apollonius of Perga]] made significant advances in the study of [[conic sections]].]]
[[Archimedes]] (c.287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], widely considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Archimedes of Syracuse&quot; p. 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer1991&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Archimedes of Syracuse&quot; p. 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of [[pi|π]] with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of π then known, 3{{sfrac|10|71}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;π&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3{{sfrac|10|70}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Archimedes of Syracuse&quot; p. 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name, obtained formulas for the [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]] (paraboloid, ellipsoid, hyperboloid),&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer1991&quot; /&gt; and an ingenious method of [[exponentiation]] for expressing very large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Archimedes of Syracuse&quot; p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices, Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Archimedes of Syracuse&quot; p. 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere, which he obtained by proving these are 2/3 the surface area and volume of a cylinder circumscribing the sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Archimedes of Syracuse&quot; p. 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262–190 BC) made significant advances to the study of [[conic sections]], showing that one can obtain all three varieties of conic section by varying the angle of the plane that cuts a double-napped cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Apollonius of Perga&quot; p. 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely [[parabola]] (&quot;place beside&quot; or &quot;comparison&quot;), &quot;ellipse&quot; (&quot;deficiency&quot;), and &quot;hyperbola&quot; (&quot;a throw beyond&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Apollonius of Perga&quot; p. 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work ''Conics'' is one of the best known and preserved mathematical works from antiquity, and in it he derives many theorems concerning conic sections that would prove invaluable to later mathematicians and astronomers studying planetary motion, such as Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Apollonius of Perga&quot; p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Apollonius nor any other Greek mathematicians made the leap to coordinate geometry, Apollonius' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and some of his work seems to anticipate the development of analytical geometry by Descartes some 1800 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Apollonius of Perga&quot; p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (c. 276–194 BC) devised the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding [[prime numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration&quot; p. 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century BC is generally regarded as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration&quot; p. 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably [[trigonometry]], largely to address the needs of astronomers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; [[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (c. 190–120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration&quot; p. 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heron of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD) is credited with [[Heron's formula]] for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots.&lt;ref&gt;S.C.

AD 90–168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration&quot; p. 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy is also credited with [[Ptolemy's theorem]] for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of π outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration&quot; p. 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a period of stagnation after Ptolemy, the period between 250 and 350 AD is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Silver Age&quot; of Greek mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[Diophantus]] made significant advances in [[algebra]], particularly [[indeterminate equation|indeterminate analysis]], which is also known as &quot;Diophantine analysis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[Diophantine equations]] and [[Diophantine approximations]] is a significant area of research to this day. His main work was the ''Arithmetica'', a collection of 150 algebraic problems dealing with exact solutions to determinate and [[indeterminate equation]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arithmetica'' had a significant influence on later mathematicians, such as [[Pierre de Fermat]], who arrived at his famous [[Fermat's Last Theorem|Last Theorem]] after trying to generalize a problem he had read in the ''Arithmetica'' (that of dividing a square into two squares).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diophantus also made significant advances in notation, the ''Arithmetica'' being the first instance of algebraic symbolism and syncopation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Among the last great Greek mathematicians is [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (4th  century AD).  He is known for his [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|hexagon theorem]] and [[Pappus's centroid theorem|centroid theorem]], as well as the [[Pappus configuration]] and [[Pappus graph]]. His ''Collection'' is a major source of knowledge on Greek mathematics as most of it has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 183-190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pappus is considered the last major innovator in Greek mathematics, with subsequent work consisting mostly of commentaries on earlier work.

[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The [[Haghia Sophia]] was designed by the Greek mathematicians [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]].]] 
The first woman mathematician recorded by history was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (AD 350–415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the [[Christianity in the Roman Empire|Christian community]] in Alexandria had her stripped publicly and executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/source/hypatia.asp Medieval Sourcebook: Socrates Scholasticus: The Murder of Hypatia (late 4th Cent.) from Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Her death is sometimes taken as the end of the era of the Alexandrian Greek mathematics, although work did continue in Athens for another century with figures such as [[Proclus]], [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] and [[Eutocius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 190-194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Proclus and Simplicius were more philosophers than mathematicians, their commentaries on earlier works are valuable sources on Greek mathematics.  The closure of the neo-Platonic [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] by the emperor [[Justinian]] in 529 AD is traditionally held as marking the end of the era of Greek mathematics, although the Greek tradition continued unbroken in the [[Byzantine empire]] with mathematicians such as [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]], the architects of the [[Haghia Sophia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Byzantine mathematics consisted mostly of commentaries, with little in the way of innovation, and the centers of mathematical innovation were to be found elsewhere by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics&quot; p. 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of early Chinese mathematics has demonstrated its unique development compared to other parts of the world, leading scholars to assume an entirely independent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;China and India&quot; p. 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant mathematical text from China is the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]'', variously dated to between 1200 BC and 100 BC, though a date of about 300 BC during the [[Warring States Period]] appears reasonable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 196&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;China and India&quot; p. 196}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips]], containing the earliest known [[decimal]] [[multiplication table]] (although ancient Babylonians had ones with a base of 60), is dated around 305 BC and is perhaps the oldest surviving mathematical text of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-times-table-hidden-in-chinese-bamboo-strips-1.14482| title =Ancient times table hidden in Chinese bamboo strips |publisher =''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''|author=Jane Qiu|date=7 January 2014| accessdate =15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called &quot;rod numerals&quot; in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|2007|pp=194–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for &quot;1&quot;, followed by the symbol for &quot;100&quot;, then the symbol for &quot;2&quot; followed by the symbol for &quot;10&quot;, followed by the symbol for &quot;3&quot;. This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;China and India&quot; p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rod numerals allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the ''[[suanpan|suan pan]]'', or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the ''suan pan'' is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in Xu Yue's ''Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures''.

The oldest existent work on [[geometry]] in China comes from the philosophical [[Mohism|Mohist]] canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of [[Mozi]] (470–390 BC). The ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needham |first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986|title=[[Science and Civilisation in China]]|volume=3, ''Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''|ref=harv|location=Taipei|publisher=Caves Books Ltd.|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 212 BC, the Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] commanded all books in the [[Qin Empire]] other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|book burning]] of 212 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for [[Chinese pagoda]] towers, engineering, [[surveying]], and includes material on [[right triangle]]s and values of [[π]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 196&quot;/&gt; It created mathematical proof for the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling (1995) [1959].

The high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurs in the 13th century (latter part of the [[Song dynasty|Song period]]), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the ''Precious Mirror of the Four Elements'' by Chu Shih-chieh (fl. 1280–1303), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to [[Horner's method]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202&quot;/&gt; The ''Precious Mirror'' also contains a diagram of [[Pascal's triangle]] with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;China and India&quot; p. 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the [[magic square]] and [[Magic circle (mathematics)|magic circles]], described in ancient times and perfected by [[Yang Hui]] (AD 1238–1298).&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205&quot; /&gt;

Even after European mathematics began to flourish during the [[Renaissance]], European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards. [[Jesuit]] missionaries such as [[Matteo Ricci]] carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205&quot;/&gt;

The next significant mathematical documents from India after the ''Sulba Sutras'' are the ''Siddhantas'', astronomical treatises from the 4th and 5th centuries AD ([[Gupta period]]) showing strong Hellenistic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;China and India&quot; p. 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are significant in that they contain the first instance of trigonometric relations based on the half-chord, as is the case in modern trigonometry, rather than the full chord, as was the case in Ptolemaic trigonometry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;China and India&quot; p. 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of translation errors, the words &quot;sine&quot; and &quot;cosine&quot; derive from the Sanskrit &quot;jiya&quot; and &quot;kojiya&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the [[Brahmi numeral]]s. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs. In the 10th century, [[Halayudha]]'s commentary on [[Pingala]]'s work contains a study of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] and [[Pascal's triangle]], and describes the formation of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the 12th century, [[Bhāskara II]]&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 182–207&lt;/ref&gt; lived in southern India and wrote extensively on all then known branches of mathematics. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives, [[Mean value theorem|the mean value theorem]] and the derivative of the sine function. To what extent he anticipated the invention of calculus is a controversial subject among historians of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 pp 197–198; George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991 pp 298–300; Takao Hayashi, ''Indian Mathematics'', pp 118–130 in ''Companion History of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', ed.

[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|Page from ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'' by [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD 820)]]
The [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] established across [[Persia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and in parts of [[History of India|India]] in the 8th century made significant contributions towards mathematics. Although most Islamic texts on mathematics were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], most of them were not written by [[Arab]]s, since much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time. [[Persian people|Persians]] contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.

In the 9th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]], were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing''). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Arabic Hegemony&quot; p. 230}} &quot;The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khwārizmī's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to teach algebra in an [[Elementary algebra|elementary form]] and for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Gandz and Saloman (1936), ''The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra'', Osiris i, pp. 263–77: &quot;In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called &quot;the father of algebra&quot; than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the fundamental method of &quot;[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]&quot; and &quot;balancing&quot;, referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khwārizmī originally described as ''al-jabr''.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=&quot;The Arabic Hegemony&quot; p. 229}} &quot;It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like &quot;restoration&quot; or &quot;completion&quot; and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to &quot;reduction&quot; or &quot;balancing&quot; – that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His algebra was also no longer concerned &quot;with a series of problems to be resolved, but an [[Expository writing|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study.&quot; He also studied an equation for its own sake and &quot;in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=0-7923-2565-6 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, [[Abu Kamil]] extended algebra to the set of [[irrational numbers]], accepting square roots and fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. One unique feature of his works was trying to find all the possible solutions to some of his problems, including one where he found 2676 solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSTM&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Springer|  pages = 4–5| last = Sesiano| first = Jacques| title = Abū Kāmil | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures| date = 1997-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.

Further developments in algebra were made by [[Al-Karaji]] in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. Something close to a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]] appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum of [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Katz|1998|loc=pp. 255–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historian]] of mathematics, F. Woepcke,&lt;ref&gt;F. Woepcke (1853). ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi''. [[Paris]].&lt;/ref&gt; praised Al-Karaji for being &quot;the first who introduced the [[theory]] of [[algebra]]ic [[calculus]].&quot; Also in the 10th century, [[Abul Wafa]] translated the works of [[Diophantus]] into Arabic. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]], and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quartic polynomial|fourth degree]]. He thus came close to finding a general formula for the [[integral]]s of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = Victor J. | year = 1995 | title = Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India | url = | journal = Mathematics Magazine | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 163–74 | doi=10.2307/2691411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyam]] wrote ''Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid'', a book about what he perceived as flaws in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], especially the [[parallel postulate]]. He was also the first to find the general geometric solution to [[cubic equation]]s. He was also very influential in [[calendar reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alam|first=S|year=2015|title=MATHEMATICS FOR ALL AND FOREVER|url=http://www.iisrr.in/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IISRR-IJR-1-Mathematics-for-All-...-Syed-Samsul-Alam.pdf|journal=Indian Institute of Social Reform &amp; Research International Journal of Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In the 13th century, [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] (Nasireddin) made advances in [[spherical trigonometry]]. He also wrote influential work on [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]]. In the 15th century, [[Ghiyath al-Kashi]] computed the value of [[π]] to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating ''n''th roots, which was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] and [[William George Horner|Horner]].

Other achievements of Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]], the discovery of all the modern [[trigonometric function]]s besides the sine, [[al-Kindi]]'s introduction of [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]], the development of [[analytic geometry]] by [[Ibn al-Haytham]], the beginning of [[algebraic geometry]] by [[Omar Khayyam]] and the development of an [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] by [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī|al-Qalasādī]].&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Empire]] from the 15th century, the development of Islamic mathematics became stagnant.

His results were lost for several centuries, and the result was proved again by Italian mathematician [[Pietro Mengoli]] in 1647 and by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]] in 1687.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Medieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the biblical passage (in the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'') that God had ''ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisdom'', 11:21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boethius]] provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term ''[[quadrivium]]'' to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote ''De institutione arithmetica'', a free translation from the Greek of [[Nicomachus]]'s ''Introduction to Arithmetic''; ''De institutione musica'', also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John (1981) &quot;The ''De Institutione Arithmetica'' and the ''De Institutione Musica''&quot;, pp. 135–54 in Margaret Gibson, ed., ''Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence,'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkerts, Menso, ''&quot;Boethius&quot; Geometrie II'', (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily [[Latin translations of the 12th century|seeking scientific Arabic texts]], including [[al-Khwārizmī]]'s ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'', translated into Latin by [[Robert of Chester]], and the complete text of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], translated in various versions by [[Adelard of Bath]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Gerard of Cremona]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, &quot;Translations and Translators&quot;, pp. 421–62 in Robert L.

Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics.

Leonardo of Pisa, now known as [[Fibonacci]], serendipitously learned about the [[Hindu–Arabic numerals]] on a trip to what is now [[Béjaïa]], [[Algeria]] with his merchant father.  (Europe was still using [[Roman numerals]].)  There, he observed a system of [[arithmetic]] (specifically [[algorism]]) which due to the [[positional notation]] of Hindu–Arabic numerals was much more efficient and greatly facilitated commerce.  Leonardo wrote ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202 (updated in 1254) introducing the technique to Europe and beginning a long period of popularizing it.  The book also brought to Europe what is now known as the [[Fibonacci sequence]] (known to Indian mathematicians for hundreds of years before that) which was used as an unremarkable example within the text.

The 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward and John E. Murdoch (1987), eds., ''Mathematics and Its Applications to Science and Natural Philosophy in the Middle Ages,'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) {{ISBN|0-521-32260-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One important contribution was development of mathematics of local motion.

[[Thomas Bradwardine]] proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion. Bradwardine expressed this by a series of specific examples, but although the logarithm had not yet been conceived, we can express his conclusion anachronistically by writing:
V = log (F/R).&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 421–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradwardine's analysis is an example of transferring a mathematical technique used by [[al-Kindi]] and [[Arnald of Villanova]] to quantify the nature of compound medicines to a different physical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, John E. (1969) &quot;''Mathesis in Philosophiam Scholasticam Introducta:'' The Rise and Development of the Application of Mathematics in Fourteenth Century Philosophy and Theology&quot;, in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge'' (Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales), at pp. 224–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the 14th-century [[Oxford Calculators]], [[William Heytesbury]], lacking [[differential calculus]] and the concept of [[Limit of a function|limits]], proposed to measure instantaneous speed &quot;by the path that '''would''' be described by [a body] '''if'''... it were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is moved in that given instant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 210, 214–15, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by [[Integral|integration]]), stating that &quot;a moving body uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a [distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Oresme]] at the [[University of Paris]] and the Italian [[Giovanni di Casali]] independently provided graphical demonstrations of this relationship, asserting that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 332–45, 382–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid's ''Elements'', Oresme made a more detailed general analysis in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated the sum of the odd numbers are the square numbers, the total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Oresme, &quot;Questions on the ''Geometry'' of Euclid&quot; Q. 14, pp. 560–65, in Marshall Clagett, ed., ''Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the development of mathematics and of [[accounting]] were intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Heeffer, Albrecht: ''On the curious historical coincidence of algebra and double-entry bookkeeping'', Foundations of the Formal Sciences, [[Ghent University]], November 2009, p.7 [http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/FOTFS2008-Heeffer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in [[Flanders]] and [[Germany]]) or [[abacus school]]s (known as ''abbaco'' in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. There is probably no need for algebra in performing [[bookkeeping]] operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of [[compound interest]], a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.

[[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) wrote books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d’Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero. ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', ed. G. Nicco Fasola, 2 vols., Florence (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero. ''Trattato d'Abaco'', ed. G. Arrighi, Pisa (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero. ''L'opera &quot;De corporibus regularibus&quot; di Pietro Franceschi detto della Francesca usurpata da Fra Luca Pacioli'', ed. G. Mancini, Rome, (1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luca Pacioli]]'s ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità]]'' (Italian: &quot;Review of [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Ratio]] and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Proportion]]&quot;) was first printed and published in [[Venice]] in 1494. It included a 27-page [[treatise]] on [[bookkeeping]], ''&quot;Particularis de Computis et Scripturis&quot;'' (Italian: &quot;Details of Calculation and Recording&quot;). It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the [[mathematical puzzles]] it contained, and to aid the education of their sons.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner &amp; Patricia McCarthy: [http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf &quot;The market for Luca Pacioli’s Summa Arithmetica&quot;] (Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Summa Arithmetica'', Pacioli introduced symbols for [[plus and minus]] for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. ''Summa Arithmetica'' was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain [[algebra]]. Pacioli obtained many of his ideas from Piero Della Francesca whom he plagiarized.

In Italy, during the first half of the 16th century, [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] discovered solutions for [[cubic equation]]s. [[Gerolamo Cardano]] published them in his 1545 book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'', together with a solution for the [[quartic equation]]s, discovered by his student [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. In 1572 [[Rafael Bombelli]] published his ''L'Algebra'' in which he showed how to deal with the [[imaginary number|imaginary quantities]] that could appear in Cardano's formula for solving cubic equations.

[[Simon Stevin]]'s book ''De Thiende'' ('the art of tenths'), first published in Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment of [[decimal notation]], which influenced all later work on the [[real number system]].

Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas, [[trigonometry]] grew to be a major branch of mathematics. [[Bartholomaeus Pitiscus]] was the first to use the word, publishing his ''Trigonometria'' in 1595. Regiomontanus's table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grattan-Guinness | first = Ivor | year = 1997 | title = The Rainbow of Mathematics: A History of the Mathematical Sciences | publisher = W.W. Norton | isbn = 0-393-32030-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Renaissance the desire of artists to represent the natural world realistically, together with the rediscovered philosophy of the Greeks, led artists to study mathematics. They were also the engineers and architects of that time, and so had need of mathematics in any case. The art of painting in perspective, and the developments in geometry that involved, were studied intensely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kline&quot;&gt;

==Mathematics during the Scientific Revolution==

===17th century===
[[Image:Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].]]
The 17th century saw an unprecedented increase of mathematical and scientific ideas across Europe. [[Galileo]] observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. [[Tycho Brahe]] had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. By his position as Brahe's assistant, [[Johannes Kepler]] was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler's calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of [[logarithm]]s by [[John Napier]] and [[Jost Bürgi]]. Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[analytic geometry]] developed by [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, in [[Cartesian coordinates]].

Building on earlier work by many predecessors, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered the laws of physics explaining [[Kepler's Laws]], and brought together the concepts now known as [[calculus]]. Independently, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}, p. 379, &quot;...the concepts of calculus...(are) so far reaching and have exercised such an impact on the modern world that it is perhaps correct to say that without some knowledge of them a person today can scarcely claim to be well educated.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, [[applied mathematics]] began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of [[probability theory]] and the corresponding rules of [[combinatorics]] in their discussions over a game of [[gambling]]. Pascal, with his [[Pascal's Wager|wager]], attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of [[utility theory]] in the 18th–19th century.

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Leonhard Euler]] by [[Emanuel Handmann]].]]

The most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably [[Leonhard Euler]]. His contributions range from founding the study of [[graph theory]] with the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol [[Imaginary unit|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new Roman;&quot;&gt;''i''&lt;/span&gt;]], and he popularized the use of the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.

Other important European mathematicians of the 18th century included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and [[Laplace]] who, in the age of [[Napoleon]], did important work on the foundations of [[celestial mechanics]] and on [[statistics]].

== Modern ==

=== 19th century ===
&lt;!-- Modern period stars here:
 * Mathematical analysis: Bolzano, Cauchy, Riemann, Weierstrass
 * &quot;Purely existential&quot; proofs by Dedekind and Hilbert
 * Dirichlet's &quot;arbitrary function&quot;
 * Cantor's different kinds of infinity
 * Concentration on structures instead of calculation (abstract algebra, non-Euclidean geometry)
 * Institutionalization
--&gt;
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].]]
Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]], leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]].

[[Image:noneuclid.svg|right|thumb|400px|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry]]
This century saw the development of the two forms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], where the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] no longer holds.
The Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]], independently defined and studied [[hyperbolic geometry]], where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180°. [[Elliptic geometry]] was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180°. Riemann also developed [[Riemannian geometry]], which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a [[manifold]], which generalizes the ideas of [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s.

The 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of [[abstract algebra]]. [[Hermann Grassmann]] in Germany gave a first version of [[vector space]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in Ireland developed [[noncommutative algebra]]. The British mathematician [[George Boole]] devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of [[mathematical logic]] and has important applications in [[computer science]].

[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.

Also, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]], a Norwegian, and [[Évariste Galois]], a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to [[trisect an arbitrary angle]], to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three [[dimension]]s in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of [[parameter space]] and [[hypercomplex number]]s.

Abel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of [[group theory]], and the associated fields of [[abstract algebra]]. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study [[symmetry]].

In the later 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] established the first foundations of [[set theory]], which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of [[mathematical logic]] in the hands of [[Peano]], [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[A.N. Whitehead]], initiated a long running debate on the [[foundations of mathematics]].

The 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1865, the [[Société Mathématique de France]] in 1872, the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] in 1884, the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] in 1883, and the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the [[Quaternion Society]], was formed in 1899, in the context of a [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|vector controversy]].

In 1897, Hensel introduced [[p-adic number]]s.

=== 20th century === &lt;!-- Hibert's problems, foundational crisis, Bourbaki --&gt;
[[Image:Four Colour Map Example.svg|thumb|A map illustrating the [[Four Color Theorem]]]]

The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in [[Klein's encyclopedia]].

In a 1900 speech to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] set out a list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems in mathematics]]. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.

Notable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, [[Wolfgang Haken]] and [[Kenneth Appel]] used a computer to prove the [[four color theorem]]. [[Andrew Wiles]], building on the work of others, proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1995. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] and [[Kurt Gödel]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is [[logical independence|independent]] of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the [[ZFC|standard axioms of set theory]]. In 1998 [[Thomas Callister Hales]] proved the [[Kepler conjecture]].

Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] (also called the &quot;enormous theorem&quot;), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[André Weil]], publishing under the [[pseudonym]] &quot;[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]&quot;, attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Mashaal, 2006. ''Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians''. [[American Mathematical Society]]. {{ISBN|0-8218-3967-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8218-3967-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|relativistic precession of apsides]]]]
[[Differential geometry]] came into its own when [[Einstein]] used it in [[general relativity]]. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], and [[John von Neumann]]'s [[game theory]] changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of [[Mathematical structure|structures]] were abstracted using axioms and given names like [[metric space]]s, [[topological space]]s etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to [[category theory]]. [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] recast [[algebraic geometry]] using [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]]. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] that [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had begun in the 1890s.
[[Measure theory]] was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the [[Lebesgue integral]], [[Kolmogorov]]'s axiomatisation of [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]]. [[Knot theory]] greatly expanded. [[Quantum mechanics]] led to the development of [[functional analysis]]. Other new areas include [[Laurent Schwartz]]'s [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]], [[Fixed-point theorem|fixed point theory]], [[singularity theory]] and [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]], [[model theory]], and [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]'s [[fractals]]. [[Lie theory]] with its [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s became one of the major areas of study.

[[Non-standard analysis]], introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]], rehabilitated the [[infinitesimal]] approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of [[Limit of a function|limits]], by extending the field of real numbers to the [[Hyperreal number]]s which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the [[surreal number]]s were discovered by [[John Horton Conway]] in connection with [[combinatorial game]]s.

The development and continual improvement of [[computer]]s, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed [[industry]] to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: [[Alan Turing]]'s [[computability theory]]; [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]; [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]]'s use of [[ENIAC]] to further number theory and the [[Lucas-Lehmer test]]; [[Rózsa Péter]]'s [[recursive function theory]]; [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]; [[signal processing]]; [[data analysis]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other areas of [[operations research]]. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on [[calculus]] and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] concepts and the expansion of [[combinatorics]] including [[graph theory]]. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as [[numerical analysis]] and [[symbolic computation]]. Some of the most important methods and [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century are: the [[simplex algorithm]], the [[Fast Fourier Transform]], [[error-correcting code]]s, the [[Kalman filter]] from [[control theory]] and the [[RSA algorithm]] of [[public-key cryptography]].

At the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the [[natural number]]s plus one of addition and multiplication, was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as [[Peano arithmetic]], was in fact [[incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of [[number theory]], including the notion of [[prime number]].) A consequence of Gödel's two [[incompleteness theorem]]s is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that [[Incompleteness theorem|cannot be proved]] within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and [[David Hilbert]]'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.

[[Image:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png|thumb|right|The [[absolute value]] of the Gamma function on the complex plane.]]
One of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan]] (1887–1920), an Indian [[autodidact]] who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of [[highly composite number]]s, the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]] and its [[asymptotics]], and [[Ramanujan theta function|mock theta functions]]. He also made major investigations in the areas of [[gamma function]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[divergent series]], [[General hypergeometric function|hypergeometric series]] and [[prime number]] theory.

[[Paul Erdős]] published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the [[Kevin Bacon Game]], which leads to the [[Erdős number]] of a mathematician. This describes the &quot;collaborative distance&quot; between a person and Paul Erdős, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.

[[Emmy Noether]] has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|last=Alexandrov|first=Pavel S.|chapter=In Memory of Emmy Noether | title = Emmy Noether: A Tribute to Her Life and Work|editor1-first =James W | editor1-last = Brewer | editor2-first = Martha K | editor2-last = Smith | place = New York | publisher= Marcel Dekker | year= 1981 | isbn = 0-8247-1550-0 |pages= 99–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].

As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] was dozens of pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2000.pdf Mathematics Subject Classification 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; More and more [[mathematical journal]]s were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to online publishing.

=== 21st century ===
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in mathematics#Problems solved since 1995}}
In 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], and in 2003 the [[Poincaré conjecture]] was solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).

Most mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards [[Open access (publishing)|open access publishing]], first popularized by the [[arXiv]].

A '''hydrogen atom''' is an [[atom]] of the [[chemical element]] [[hydrogen]]. The [[Electric charge|electrically]] neutral atom contains a single positively charged [[proton]] and a single negatively charged [[electron]] bound to the nucleus by the [[Coulomb force]]. '''Atomic hydrogen''' constitutes [[abundance of the chemical elements|about 75%]] of the [[baryon]]ic mass of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

In everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called &quot;atomic hydrogen&quot;) are extremely rare. Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary ([[diatomic]]) hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &quot;Atomic hydrogen&quot; and &quot;hydrogen atom&quot; in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).

Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the hydrogen atom have been important to the [[history of quantum mechanics]].

==Isotopes==
{{Main article|Isotopes of hydrogen}}
The most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] [[isotope]], '''hydrogen-1''', '''protium''', or '''light hydrogen''', contains no [[neutron]]s and is simply a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]. Protium is [[Proton decay|stable]] and makes up 99.9885% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.

[[Deuterium]] contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0115% of naturally occurring hydrogen and is used in industrial processes like [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Deuterium NMR|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]].

[[Tritium]] contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a [[half-life]] of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.

Higher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]] and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

The formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the [[Rydberg constant]] (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.

==Hydrogen ion==
{{Main article|Hydron (chemistry)}}
Hydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as &quot;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; as in the solvation of classical acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]], the [[hydronium ion]], [[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to form H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Ionized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the [[interstellar medium]], and [[solar wind]].

==Theoretical analysis==
The hydrogen atom has special significance in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] as a simple [[two-body problem]] physical system which has yielded many simple [[closed-form expression|analytical]] solutions in closed-form.

=== Failed classical description ===
[[Rutherford model|Experiments]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. [[Classical electromagnetism]] had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the [[Larmor formula]]. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/orbitdecay.pdf|title = Classical Lifetime of a Bohr Atom|date = March 7, 2005|website = |publisher = Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University|last = Olsen|first = James|last2 = McDonald|first2 = Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_\text{fall} \approx \frac{ a_0^3}{4 r_0^2 c} \approx 1.6 \cdot 10^{-11} \text{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]] and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]]. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Bohr-Sommerfeld Model ===
{{Main article|Bohr model}}In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model. The assumptions included:
# Electrons can only be in certain, discrete circular orbits or ''stationary states'', thereby having a discrete set of possible radii and energies.
# Electrons do not emit radiation while in one of these stationary states.
# An electron can gain or lose energy by jumping from one discrete orbital to another. 
Bohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible values:

&lt;math&gt;L = n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n = 1,2,3,...&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant]] over &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. He also supposed that the [[centripetal force]] which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch115/carter/files/103more/BohrEquations.pdf|title = Derivation of Bohr’s Equations for the One-electron Atom|website = |publisher = University of Massachusetts Boston|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E_n = - \frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 } \frac{1}{n^2}   &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;m_e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron mass]], &lt;math&gt;e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|electric permeability]], and &lt;math&gt;n   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[quantum number]] (now known as the [[principal quantum number]]). Bohr's predictions matched experiments measuring the [[hydrogen spectral series]] to the first order, giving more confidence to a theory that used quantized values.

For &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the value
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 } =\frac{m_{\text{e}} e^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_0^2}= 1 Ry = 13.605\;692\;53(30) \,\text{eV} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;codata&quot;&gt;P.J. Mohr, B.N. Taylor, and D.B. Newell (2011), &quot;The 2010 CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants&quot; (Web Version 6.0). This database was developed by J. Baker, M. Douma, and S. Kotochigova. Available: http://physics.nist.gov/constants. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ryd Link to R&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;], [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rydhcev Link to hcR&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
is called the Rydberg unit of energy. It is related to the [[Rydberg constant]] &lt;math&gt;R_\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[atomic physics]] by &lt;math&gt;1 \,\text{Ry} \equiv h c R_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]), and hydrogen-3 ([[tritium]]) the constant must be slightly modified to use the [[reduced mass]] of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the values are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a hydrogen atom (one electron), ''R'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;R_M = \frac{R_\infty}{1+m_{\text{e}}/M},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the atomic nucleus.  For hydrogen-1, the quantity &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{e}}/M,&lt;/math&gt; is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of ''R'', and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.

There were still problems with Bohr's model: 
# it failed to predict other spectral details such as [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]]
# it could only predict energy levels with any accuracy for single–electron atoms (hydrogen–like atoms)
# the predicted values were only correct to &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 \approx 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]].

Most of these shortcomings were repaired by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Arnold Sommerfeld's]] modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[declination]] with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital [[angular momentum]] and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous [[Zeeman effect]] remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the [[Dirac equation]]. It is often alleged, that the [[Schrödinger equation]] is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories.  It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.

=== Schrödinger equation ===
The Schrödinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.

==== Wavefunction ====
The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron. Using the time-independent Schrödinger equation, ignoring all spin-coupling interactions and using the [[reduced mass]] &lt;math&gt;\mu=m_e M/(m_e + M)&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is written as:

&lt;math&gt;\left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \nabla^2  - \frac{  e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \right) \psi(r,\theta, \phi) = E \psi(r, \theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian]] in spherical coordinates:

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \left[ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{ \partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - \frac{e^2}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \psi= E \psi&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[Separation of variables|separable]], [[partial differential equation]] which can be solved in terms of special functions.  The normalized position [[wavefunction]]s, given in [[spherical coordinates]] are:
::&lt;math&gt; \psi_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi) = \sqrt {{\left (  \frac{2}{n a^*_0} \right )}^3 \frac{(n-\ell-1)!}{2n(n+\ell)!}} e^{- \rho / 2} \rho^{\ell} L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Hydrogen eigenstate n4 l3 m1.png|thumb|right|3D illustration of the eigenstate &lt;math&gt;\psi_{4,3,1}&lt;/math&gt;. Electrons in this state are 45% likely to be found within the solid body shown.]]
where:
::&lt;math&gt; \rho = {2r \over {n a^*_0}} &lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; a^*_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Bohr radius]], &lt;math&gt;a^*_0={{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}\over{\mu e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Laguerre polynomial#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomial]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' − ''ℓ'' − 1}}, and
::&lt;math&gt; Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) \,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[spherical harmonic]] function of degree ''ℓ'' and order ''m''. Note that the generalized Laguerre polynomials are defined differently by different authors. The usage here is consistent with the definitions used by Messiah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messiah|first=Albert|title=Quantum Mechanics|date=1999|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-40924-4|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mathematica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/LaguerreL.html LaguerreL]. Wolfram Mathematica page&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, the Laguerre polynomial includes a factor of &lt;math&gt;(n+\ell)!&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; or the generalized Laguerre polynomial appearing in the hydrogen wave function is &lt;math&gt; L_{n+\ell}^{2\ell+1}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condon and Shortley|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|date=1963|publisher=Cambridge|location=London|pages=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum numbers can take the following values: 
::&lt;math&gt; n=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ell=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;m=-\ell,\ldots,\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, these wavefunctions are ''normalized'' (i.e., the integral of their modulus square equals 1) and [[Orthogonal functions|orthogonal]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} r^2 dr\int_0^{\pi} \sin \vartheta d\vartheta \int_0^{2 \pi} d\varphi\; \psi^*_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)\psi_{n'\ell'm'}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)=\langle n,\ell, m | n', \ell', m' \rangle = \delta_{nn'} \delta_{\ell\ell'} \delta_{mm'},&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen are [[analytical expression|analytical]], giving a simple expression for the hydrogen [[energy levels]] and thus the frequencies of the hydrogen [[spectral line]]s and fully reproduced the Bohr model and went beyond it. It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function (&quot;orbital&quot;) for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the [[anisotropic]] character of atomic bonds.

The Schrödinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and [[molecule]]s. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.

Since the Schrödinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The [[Dirac equation]] of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).

==== Results of Schrödinger equation ====
The solution of the Schrödinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb potential]] produced by the nucleus is [[isotropic]] (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting [[energy eigenfunctions]] (the ''orbitals'') are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the [[Spherical coordinate system|angular coordinates]] follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the [[angular momentum operator]]. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum [[quantum number]]s, ''ℓ'' and ''m'' (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ...}} determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} −''ℓ'', ..., +''ℓ''}} determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) ''z''-axis.

In addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/''r'' Coulomb potential enter (leading to [[Laguerre polynomials]] in ''r''). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, ...}}. The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.

Note that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to ''n'' − 1, i.e. {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}}.

Due to angular momentum conservation, states of the same ''ℓ'' but different ''m'' have the same energy (this holds for all problems with [[rotational symmetry]]). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same ''n'' but different ''ℓ'' are also [[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/''r'' (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).

Taking into account the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the ''z''-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any [[eigenstate]] of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of these states. This explains also why the choice of ''z''-axis for the directional [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ''ℓ'' and ''m''&amp;prime; obtained for another preferred axis ''z''&amp;prime; can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different ''m'' (but same ''l'') that have been obtained for ''z''.

==== Mathematical summary of eigenstates of hydrogen atom ====
{{main article|Hydrogen-like atom}}

In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]], and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component &quot;[[Dirac spinor]]&quot; including &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; spin components, with both positive and &quot;negative&quot; energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schrödinger solution.

=====Energy levels=====
The energy levels of hydrogen, including [[fine structure]] (excluding [[Lamb shift]] and [[hyperfine structure]]), are given by the [[Fine-structure constant|Sommerfeld fine structure]] expression:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerfeld&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Arnold |last= Sommerfeld|title=Atombau und Spektrallinien'|  publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn|location=Braunschweig|year=1919|isbn=3-87144-484-7}} [https://archive.org/stream/atombauundspekt00sommgoog German] [https://archive.org/details/AtomicStructureAndSpectralLines English]&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} E_{j\,n} &amp; = -\mu c^2\left[1-\left(1+\left[\dfrac{\alpha}{n-j-\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{\left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2-\alpha^2}}\right]^2\right)^{-1/2}\right] \\ &amp; \approx -\dfrac{\mu c^2\alpha^2}{2n^2} \left[1 + \dfrac{\alpha^2}{n^2}\left(\dfrac{n}{j+\frac{1}{2}} - \dfrac{3}{4} \right) \right] , \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''j'' is the &quot;total angular momentum&quot; [[quantum number]], which is equal to |''ℓ'' ± {{sfrac|1|2}}| depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schrödinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see [[#Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution]]). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|A. Sommerfeld]] in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the [[Old quantum theory|old Bohr theory]]. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.

=== Visualizing the hydrogen electron orbitals ===
{{main article|Atomic orbital}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|frame|Probability densities through the ''xz''-plane for the electron at different quantum numbers (''ℓ'', across top; ''n'', down side; ''m'' = 0)]]
The image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the [[probability amplitude|probability density]] that are color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number ''ℓ'' is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (''s'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''p'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''d'' means ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2). The main (principal) quantum number ''n'' (= 1, 2, 3, ...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum number ''m'' has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the ''xz''-plane (''z'' is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the ''z''-axis.

The &quot;[[ground state]]&quot;, i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1''s'' state ([[principal quantum level]] ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 0).

Black lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero.  (More precisely, the nodes are [[spherical harmonics]] that appear as a result of solving [[Schrödinger equation]] in polar coordinates.)

The [[quantum number]]s determine the layout of these nodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.byu.edu/faculty/durfee/courses/Summer2009/physics222/AtomicQuantumNumbers.pdf Summary of atomic quantum numbers]. Lecture notes. 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There are:
* &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; total nodes,
* &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of which are angular nodes:
** &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; angular nodes go around the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; axis (in the xy plane). &lt;small&gt;(The figure above does not show these nodes since it plots cross-sections through the xz-plane.)&lt;/small&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;l-m&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining angular nodes) occur on the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (vertical) axis.
* &lt;math&gt;n - l - 1&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining non-angular nodes) are radial nodes.

==== Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution ====
There are several important effects that are neglected by the Schrödinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:

* Although the mean speed of the electron in hydrogen is only 1/137th of the [[speed of light]], many modern experiments are sufficiently precise that a complete theoretical explanation requires a fully relativistic treatment of the problem. A relativistic treatment results in a momentum increase of about 1 part in 37,000 for the electron. Since the electron's wavelength is determined by its momentum, orbitals containing higher speed electrons show contraction due to smaller wavelengths.
* Even when there is no external [[magnetic field]], in the [[inertial frame]] of the moving electron, the electromagnetic field of the nucleus has a magnetic component. The spin of the electron has an associated [[magnetic moment]] which interacts with this magnetic field. This effect is also explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called ''[[spin-orbit coupling]]'', i.e., an interaction between the [[electron]]'s [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] around the nucleus, and its [[spin (physics)|spin]].

Both of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]], with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the [[Total angular momentum quantum number|total angular momentum number]] ''j'' (arising through the coupling between [[electron spin]] and [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]). States of the same ''j'' and the same ''n'' are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of [[Dirac equation]] predicts 2S({{sfrac|1|2}}) and 2P({{sfrac|1|2}}) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations ([[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]]).

* There are always [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s of the [[electromagnetic field]], according to quantum mechanics. Due to such fluctuations degeneracy between states of the same j but different l is lifted, giving them slightly different energies. This has been demonstrated in the famous [[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]] and was the starting point for the development of the theory of [[Quantum electrodynamics]] (which is able to deal with these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous [[Feynman diagram]]s for approximations using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]). This effect is now called [[Lamb shift]].

For these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.

== Alternatives to the Schrödinger theory ==
In the language of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, the hydrogen  atom was first solved by [[Wolfgang Pauli]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pauli_1926&quot;&gt;

and the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]]. By extending the symmetry group O(4) to the [[dynamical group]] O(4,2),
the entire spectrum and all transitions were embedded in a single irreducible group representation.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Elagabalus''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|g|æ|b|əl|ə|s}}, also known as '''Heliogabalus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus}}; {{circa}} 203 – March 11, 222), was [[Roman emperor]] from 218 to 222. A member of the [[Severan dynasty]], he was [[Roman Syria|Syrian]], the second son of [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]]. In his early youth he served as a priest of [[Elagabalus (deity)|the god Elagabalus]] in the hometown of his mother's family, [[Homs#Emesani dynasty and Roman rule|Emesa]]. As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of his nomenclature, see Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, ''Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction?'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon becoming emperor he took the name '''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus'''. He was called Elagabalus only after his death.&lt;ref&gt;The first known instance is in the [[Chronography of 354]], in the list of emperors in the section titled ''Chronica Urbis Romae'', where he is called Antoninus Elagaballus.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_16_chronicle_of_the_city_of_rome.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 217, the emperor [[Caracalla]] was [[assassination|assassinated]] and replaced by his [[Praetorian prefect]], [[Macrinus|Marcus Opellius Macrinus]]. Caracalla's maternal aunt, [[Julia Maesa]], successfully instigated a revolt among the [[Legio III Gallica]] to have her eldest grandson (and Caracalla's cousin), Elagabalus, declared emperor in his place. Macrinus was defeated on 8 June 218 at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]]. Elagabalus, barely 14 years old, became emperor, initiating a reign remembered mainly for [[sex scandal]]s and religious controversy.

Later historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual [[taboos]]. He replaced the traditional head of the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], with the deity Elagabalus, of whom he had been high priest. He forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, over which he personally presided. Elagabalus was supposedly &quot;married&quot; as many as five times, lavishing favours on male courtiers popularly thought to have been his lovers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StIqd8etrLoC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=Whoopee+cushion+elagabalus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tZB-TOvsB5CTjAfQ05zzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=whoopee&amp;f=false |title=Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire |first1=Warwick |last1=Ball |authorlink=Warwick Ball |place=London New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |page=412 |isbn=0-415-24357-2 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://focreviews.blogspot.com/2011/09/crimes-of-elagabalus-by-martjin-icks.html |date=15 September 2011 |title=The Crimes of Elagabalus |first1=Martjin |last1=Icks |publisher=Literary Review |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reported to have prostituted himself in the imperial palace. His behavior estranged the [[Praetorian Guard]], the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], and the common people alike. Amidst growing opposition, Elagabalus, just 18 years old, was assassinated and replaced by his much more favorable cousin [[Severus Alexander]] on 11 March 222, who ruled for 13 years before his own assassination which would mark the epoch event for the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The assasination plot against Elagabalus was devised by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard.

Elagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]], [[decadence]], and [[zealotry]].&lt;ref name=emperorsatbay&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire at Bay: Ad 180–395 |first=David Stone |last=Potter |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-10057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has persisted, and with writers of the early modern age he suffers one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors. [[Edward Gibbon]], for example, wrote that Elagabalus &quot;abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures and ungoverned fury&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter VI.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], &quot;The name Elagabalus is branded in history above all others&quot; because of his &quot;unspeakably disgusting life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, B.G. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofrome001903mbp History of Rome]'', p. 144 (1844). Elagabalus' vices were &quot;too disgusting even to allude to them&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; His unstable reign has also been marked as a major point leading to the eventual [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]].

Elagabalus was born around the year 203&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre503.html V.3]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]] and [[Julia Soaemias|Julia Soaemias Bassiana]]. His father was initially a member of the [[Equites]] class, but was later elevated to the rank of [[Roman Senate|senator]]. His grandmother, [[Julia Maesa]], was the widow of the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Julius Avitus]], the sister of [[Julia Domna]], and the sister-in-law of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxix-30&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-30 LXXIX.30]&lt;/ref&gt; He had at least one sibling: an unnamed elder brother.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Septimius Severus: The African Emperor'', p.p.217&amp;222-223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/va-vh/varius/varius_marcellus.html Sextus Varius Marcellus' article at Livius.org]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Julia Soaemias, was a cousin of the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]]. His other relatives included his aunt [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] and uncle [[Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus]] and among their children, their son [[Severus Alexander]]. Elagabalus's family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god Elagabal, of whom Elagabalus was the [[high priest]] at Emesa (modern [[Homs]]) in [[Roman Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;

The deity [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]] was initially venerated at Emesa. This form of the god's name is a Latinized version of the Syrian ''Ilāh hag-Gabal'', which derives from [[El (deity)|''Ilāh'']] (a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word for &quot;god&quot;) and ''gabal'' (an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for &quot;mountain&quot;), resulting in &quot;the God of the Mountain,&quot; the Emesene manifestation of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lenormant | first = Francois | authorlink = François Lenormant | title = Sol Elagabalus | journal = Revue de l'Histoire des Religions | volume = 3 | page = 310 | year = 1881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cult of the deity spread to other parts of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century; a dedication has been found as far away as [[Woerden]] ([[Netherlands]]), near the Roman ''limes''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/woerden-elagabal.html An Early Dedication to Elagabal]&quot; at [[Livius.org]]; the inscription is in now in Woerden's [http://www.stadsmuseumwoerden.nl/ city museum].&lt;/ref&gt; The god was later imported and assimilated with the Roman sun god known as [[Sol (mythology)|Sol Indiges]] in [[Roman Republic|republican]] times and as [[Sol Invictus]] during the second and third centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Devlaminck, Pieter | title = De Cultus van Sol Invictus: Een vergelijkende studie tussen keizer Elagabalus (218–222) en keizer Aurelianus (270–275) | publisher = University of Ghent | year = 2004 | language = Dutch | url = http://www.ethesis.net/invictus/invictus_inhoud.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek the sun god is [[Helios]], hence &quot;Heliogabalus&quot;, a hybrid conjunction of &quot;Helios&quot; and &quot;Elagabalus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==

When the emperor [[Macrinus]] came to power, he suppressed the threat against his reign from the family of his assassinated predecessor, Caracalla, by exiling them—Julia Maesa, her two daughters, and her eldest grandson Elagabalus—to their estate at Emesa in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt; Almost upon arrival in Syria, Maesa began a plot with her advisor and Elagabalus' tutor, [[Gannys]], to overthrow Macrinus and elevate the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus to the imperial throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whittemore33&quot;&gt;Walter J. Whittemore Jr., ''Untimely Deaths by Assassination''. (2012) p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother publicly declared that he was the illegitimate son of Caracalla, and therefore deserving the loyalty of Roman soldiers and senators who had sworn allegiance to Caracalla.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; After Julia Maesa displayed her wealth to the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Legion]] at [[Raphana]] they swore allegiance to Elagabalus. At sunrise on 16 May 218, [[Publius Valerius Comazon]], commander of the legion, declared him emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-31 LXXIX.31]&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen his legitimacy Elagabalus assumed Caracalla's names, ''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-32 LXXIX.32]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Icks12&quot;&gt;Icks, (2011) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In response Macrinus dispatched his [[Praetorian prefect]] Ulpius Julianus to the region with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough to crush the [[rebellion]]. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' head was sent back to the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Icks12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre504.html V.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrinus now sent letters to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] denouncing Elagabalus as the ''False Antoninus'' and claiming he was insane.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-36 LXXIX.36]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Roman consul|consul]]s and other high-ranking members of Rome's leadership condemned Elagabalus, and the Senate subsequently declared war on both Elagabalus and Julia Maesa.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-38 LXXIX.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrinus and his son, weakened by the desertion of the [[Legio II Parthica|Second Legion]] due to bribes and promises circulated by Julia Maesa, were defeated on 8 June 218 at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]] by troops commanded by Gannys.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;/&gt; Macrinus fled to [[Italy]], disguised as a courier, but was intercepted near [[Chalcedon]] and executed in [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;/&gt; His son [[Diadumenian]], sent as a friendly hostage to the [[Parthia]]n court as a guarantee of peace between the states, was captured at [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] and also put to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-4&quot;/&gt;

Elagabalus declared the date of the victory at Antioch to be the beginning of his reign and assumed the imperial titles without prior senatorial approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-2&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-2 LXXX.2]&lt;/ref&gt; This violated tradition but was a common practice among 3rd-century emperors nonetheless. Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to [[Rome]] extending [[amnesty]] to the Senate and recognizing the laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-1 LXXX.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The senators responded by acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting his claim to be the son of Caracalla.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre505.html V.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Caracalla and Julia Domna were both [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|deified]] by the Senate, both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated to the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustae]],&lt;ref name=&quot;benario-soamias-mamaea&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Benario | first = Herbert W. | title = The Titulature of Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea: Two Notes | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 90 | pages = 9–14 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.2307/283691 | publisher = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 90 | jstor=283691}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the memory of both Macrinus and Diadumenian was expunged by the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-2&quot;/&gt; The former commander of the Third Legion, Comazon, was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-4&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-4 LXXX.4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor (218–222)==
[[Image:Elagabalus Denarius Fortuna Head.png|thumb|right|A [[denarius]] commissioned by Elagabalus, bearing his likeness]]

Elagabalus and his entourage spent the winter of 218 in [[Bithynia]] at [[Nicomedia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; where the emperor's religious beliefs first presented themselves as a problem. The contemporary historian [[Cassius Dio]] suggests that Gannys was in fact killed by the new emperor because he pressured Elagabalus to live &quot;temperately and prudently&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-6&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-6 LXXX.6]&lt;/ref&gt; To help Romans adjust to having an oriental priest as emperor, Julia Maesa had a painting of Elagabalus in priestly robes sent to Rome and hung over a statue of the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] in the [[Curia Julia|Senate House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; This placed senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to Elagabalus whenever they made offerings to Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;van Zoonen, Lauren (2005). [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/heliogabalus/heliogabalus2.html#Life1 &quot;Heliogabalus&quot;]. livius.org. Retrieved 10 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The legions were dismayed by his behaviour and quickly came to regret having supported his accession.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt; While Elagabalus was still on his way to Rome, brief revolts broke out by the [[Legio IV Scythica|Fourth Legion]] at the instigation of [[Gellius Maximus]], and by the Third Legion, which itself had been responsible for the elevation of Elagabalus to the throne, under the command of Senator [[Verus (senator)|Verus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-7&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-7 LXXX.7]&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion was quickly put down, and the Third Legion disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = van Zoonen | first = Lauren | title = Heliogabalus | url = http://www.livius.org/he-hg/heliogabalus/heliogabalus2.html#Life1 | year = 2005 | publisher = livius.org | accessdate = 2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the entourage reached Rome in the autumn of 219, Comazon and other allies of Julia Maesa and Elagabalus were given powerful and lucrative positions, to the chagrin of many senators who did not consider them worthy of such privileges.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre507.html V.7]&lt;/ref&gt; After his tenure as [[Praetorian prefect]], Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as [[Roman consul|consul]] twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-4&quot;/&gt; Elagabalus soon devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the ''[[denarius]]'' from 58% to 46.5%&amp;nbsp;— the actual silver weight dropping from 1.82&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.41&amp;nbsp;grams. He also demonetized the ''[[antoninianus]]'' during this period in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101003844/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm |date=November 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elagabalus tried to have his presumed lover, the charioteer [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], declared [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-15&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-15 LXXX.15]&lt;/ref&gt; while another alleged lover, the athlete Aurelius Zoticus, was appointed to the non-administrative but influential position of Master of the Chamber, or ''[[Cubicularius]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-16&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-16 LXXX.16]&lt;/ref&gt; His offer of amnesty for the Roman upper class was largely honoured, though the [[jurist]] [[Ulpian]] was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, (1996) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His mother and grandmother became the first women to be allowed into the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Burns, ''Great Women of Imperial Rome: Mothers and Wives of the Caesars'' (2007) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of ''Clarissima,'' and Maesa the more unorthodox ''Mater Castrorum et Senatus'' (&quot;Mother of the army camp and of the Senate&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;benario-soamias-mamaea&quot;/&gt; They held the title of ''Augusta'' as well, suggesting that they may have been the power behind the throne. Indeed, they exercised great influence over the young emperor throughout his reign, and can be found on many coins and inscriptions—a rare honor for Roman women.&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious controversy===
[[Image:Elagabalus Aureus Sol Invictus.png|thumb|310px|A Roman [[aureus]] depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads ''Sanct(o) Deo Soli Elagabal(o)'' (''To the Holy Sun God Elagabalus''), and depicts a [[quadriga|four-horse]], gold chariot carrying the holy stone of the [[Emesa]] temple.]]

Since the reign of [[Septimius Severus]], [[sun worship]] had increased throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halsberghe | first = Gaston H. | title = The Cult of Sol Invictus | year = 1972 | location = Leiden | page = 36|publisher= Brill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elagabalus saw this as an opportunity to install Elagabal as the chief deity of the [[Roman pantheon]]. The god was renamed ''[[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'', meaning ''God the Undefeated Sun'', and honored above [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-11&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11 LXXX.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a token of respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either [[Astarte]], [[Minerva]], [[Urania]], or some combination of the three to Elagabal as consort.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html V.6]&lt;/ref&gt; A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, there may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and Minerva.&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011), pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

He aroused further discontent when he married the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Aquilia Severa]], claiming the marriage would produce &quot;godlike children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-9&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-9 LXXX.9]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a flagrant breach of Roman law and tradition, which held that any Vestal found to have engaged in sexual intercourse was to be [[buried alive]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', Life of Numa Pompilius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lavish temple called the [[Elagabalium]] was built on the east face of the [[Palatine Hill]] to house Elagabal, who was represented by a black conical [[Baetylus|meteorite]] from Emesa.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; [[Herodian]] wrote &quot;this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven; on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out, which the people would like to believe are a rough picture of the sun, because this is how they see them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-3&quot;/&gt;

In order to become the high priest of his new religion, Elagabalus had himself circumcised.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-11&quot;/&gt; He forced senators to watch while he danced around the altar of Deus Sol Invictus to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-5&quot;/&gt; Each summer [[solstice]] he held a festival dedicated to the god, which became popular with the masses because of the free food distributed on these occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; During this festival, Elagabalus placed the Emesa stone on a [[chariot]] adorned with gold and jewels, which he paraded through the city:

{{quote|A six horse chariot carried the divinity, the horses huge and flawlessly white, with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the reins, and no one rode in the chariot; the vehicle was escorted as if the god himself were the charioteer. Elagabalus ran backward in front of the chariot, facing the god and holding the horses' reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion, looking up into the face of his god.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt;}}

The most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including the emblem of the [[Cybele|Great Mother]], the fire of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the [[Ancile|Shields]] of the [[Salii]], and the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], so that no other god could be worshipped except in association with Elagabal.&lt;ref&gt;Icks, (2011) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex/gender controversy===
[[Image:Aquilia Severa coin obverse.png|thumb|right|Roman denarius depicting [[Aquilia Severa]], the second wife of Elagabalus. The marriage caused a public outrage because Aquilia was a [[Vestal Virgin]], sworn by Roman law to [[celibacy]] for 30 years.]]

The question of Elagabalus' [[sexual orientation]] is confused, owing to salacious and unreliable sources. Elagabalus married and divorced five women,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-9&quot;/&gt; three of whom are known. His first wife was [[Julia Cornelia Paula]];&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; the second was the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Aquilia Severa|Julia Aquilia Severa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, (1996) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a year, he abandoned her and married [[Annia Faustina|Annia Aurelia Faustina]],&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; a descendant of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and the widow of a man he had recently had executed. He had returned to his second wife Severa by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-9&quot;/&gt; According to Cassius Dio, his most stable relationship seems to have been with his [[quadriga|chariot]] driver, a blond slave from [[Caria]] named Hierocles, whom he referred to as his husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-15&quot;/&gt;

The ''Augustan History'' claims that he also married a man named Zoticus, an athlete from Smyrna, in a public ceremony at Rome.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio reported that Elagabalus would paint his eyes, [[plucking (hair removal)|depilate]] his body hair and wear wigs before [[prostitution|prostituting]] himself in taverns, brothels,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-14 LXXX.14]&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the imperial palace:

{{quote|Finally, he set aside a room in the palace and there committed his indecencies, always standing nude at the door of the room, as the harlots do, and shaking the curtain which hung from gold rings, while in a soft and melting voice he solicited the passers-by. There were, of course, men who had been specially instructed to play their part. For, as in other matters, so in this business, too, he had numerous agents who sought out those who could best please him by their foulness. He would collect money from his patrons and give himself airs over his gains; he would also dispute with his associates in this shameful occupation, claiming that he had more lovers than they and took in more money.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-13 LXXX.13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodian commented that Elagabalus enhanced his natural good looks by the regular application of cosmetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-6&quot;/&gt; He was described as having been &quot;delighted to be called the mistress, the wife, the queen of Hierocles&quot; and was reported to have offered vast sums of money to any physician who could equip him with female genitalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-16&quot;/&gt; Elagabalus has been characterized by some modern writers as [[transgender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Benjamin | first = Harry | last2 = Green | first2 = Richard | title = The Transsexual Phenomenon, Appendix C: Transsexualism: Mythological, Historical, and Cross-Cultural Aspects. | publisher = The Julian Press, Inc. | year = 1966 | location = New York | url = http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/appendix_c.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717204538/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/appendix_c.htm | archivedate = 2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq-enc-elagabal&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Godbout | first = Louis | title = Elagabalus | encyclopedia = GLBTQ: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture | publisher = glbtq, Inc. | location = Chicago | year = 2004 | url = http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/elagabalus.html | accessdate = 2007-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Varner-2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Varner |first=Eric |date=2008 |title=Transcending Gender: Assimilation, Identity, and Roman Imperial Portraits. |jstor=40379354 |journal=Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome.

===Fall from power===
By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, particularly his relationship with Hierocles,&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-history-lxxx-15&quot;/&gt; increasingly provoked the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt; When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided that he and his mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt; As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, [[Julia Avita Mamaea]], and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old [[Severus Alexander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt;

Prevailing on Elagabalus, she arranged that he appoint his cousin Alexander as his heir and that the boy be given the title of ''Caesar''. Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-7&quot;/&gt; However, Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began to suspect that the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre508.html V.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the failure of various attempts on Alexander's life, Elagabalus stripped his cousin of his titles, revoked his consulship, and invented the rumor that Alexander was near death, in order to see how the Praetorians would react.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;/&gt; A riot ensued, and the Guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;/&gt;

==== Assassination ====
The emperor complied and on 11 March 222 he publicly presented his cousin along with his own mother, Julia Soaemias. On their arrival the soldiers started cheering Alexander while ignoring Elagabalus, who ordered the summary arrest and execution of anyone who had taken part in this display of insubordination.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodian-history-v-8&quot;/&gt; In response, members of the [[Praetorian Guard]] attacked Elagabalus and his mother:

{{quote|He made an attempt to flee, and would have got away somewhere by being placed in a chest had he not been discovered and slain, at the age of eighteen.

==Sources==

===Augustan History===
The source of many of these stories of Elagabalus's depravity is the ''[[Augustan History]]'' (''Historia Augusta''), which includes controversial claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | page = 218 | isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia Augusta'' was most likely written toward the end of the 4th century during the reign of emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cizek | first = Eugen | title = Histoire et historiens à Rome dans l'Antiquité | year = 1995 | location = Lyon | publisher = Presses universitaires de Lyon | page = 297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Elagabalus as described in the ''Augustan History'' is of uncertain historical merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | page = 263 | isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections 13 to 17, relating to the fall of Elagabalus, are less controversial among historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Butler | first = Orma Fitch | title = Studies in the life of Heliogabalus | journal = University of Michigan studies: Humanistic series IV | year = 1910 | location = New York | publisher = MacMillan | page = 140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius Dio===
Sources often considered more credible than the ''Augustan History'' include the contemporary historians [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Herodian]]. Cassius Dio lived from the second half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor [[Commodus]] and governor of [[Smyrna]] after the death of [[Septimius Severus]]. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in [[Africa province|Africa]] and [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter 80.18&quot;&gt;chapter 80.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus Alexander held him in high esteem and made him his consul again. His ''Roman History'' spans nearly a [[millennium]], from the arrival of [[Aeneas]] in Italy until the year 229. As a contemporary of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the ''Augustan History'', although by his own admission&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter 80.18&quot;/&gt; Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand information.

Furthermore, the political climate in the aftermath of Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as [[Sardanapalus]], partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake,&lt;ref&gt;80.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | pages = 145–146 | isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodian===
[[File:Medal of Elagabalus.jpg|thumb|250px|Medal of Elagabalus, [[Louvre Museum]].]]

Another contemporary of Elagabalus' was [[Herodian]], a minor Roman civil servant who lived from c. 170 until 240. His work, ''History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius'', commonly abbreviated as ''Roman History'', is an eyewitness account of the reign of [[Commodus]] until the beginning of the reign of [[Gordian III]]. His work largely overlaps with Dio's own ''Roman History'', but the texts, written independently of each other, agree more often than not about the emperor and his short but eventful reign .&lt;ref name=&quot;livius-herodian&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Lendering | first = Jona | authorlink = Jona Lendering | title = Herodian | year = 2004 | url = http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/herodian.html | publisher = Livius.org | accessdate = 2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Herodian is not deemed as reliable as Cassius Dio, his lack of literary and scholarly pretensions make him less biased than senatorial historians. Herodian is considered the most important source for the religious reforms which took place during the reign of Elagabalus, which have been confirmed by [[numismatics|numismatic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohen | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Cohen (numismatist) | title = Description Historiques des Monnaies Frappées sous l'Empire Romain (8 volumes) | year = 1880–1892 | location = Paris | page = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Babelon | author-link = Ernest Babelon | first = Ernest Charles François | title = Monnaies Consulaires II | year = 1885–1886 | location = Bologna | publisher = Forni | pages = 63–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', {{CIL|02|1409}}, {{CIL|02|1410}}, {{CIL|02|1413}}, and CIL III: 564-589.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edward Gibbon and later historians====
For readers of the modern age, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737–94) further cemented the scandalous reputation of Elagabalus. Gibbon not only accepted and expressed outrage at the allegations of the ancient historians, but he might have added some details of his own; he is the first historian known to claim that [[Gannys]] was a [[eunuch]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/download_file/202595/ &quot;Pseudo-Eunuchs in the Court of Elagabalus&quot;], 1999, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon wrote:

{{quote|To confound the order of the season and climate, to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects, and to subvert every law of nature and decency, were in the number of his most delicious amusements. A long train of concubines, and a rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred asylum, were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman world affected to copy the manners and dress of the female sex, preferring the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonored the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers; one of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperor's, or, as he more properly styled himself, the empress's husband. It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice. Yet, confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people, and attested by grave and contemporary historians, their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Two hundred years after the age of Pliny, the use of pure, or even of mixed silks, was confined to the female sex, till the opulent citizens of Rome and the provinces were insensibly familiarized with the example of Elagabalus, the first who, by this effeminate habit, had sullied the dignity of an emperor and a man.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter XL.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some recent historians paint a more favourable picture of the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in ''Images of Elagabalus'' (2008; republished as ''The Crimes of Elagabalus'' in 2012), doubts the reliability of the ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in ''The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction?'' (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality played a role in the fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Elagabalus Forchtenstein.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Elagabalus on a wall painting at [[Forchtenstein Castle]] ]]
Due to the ancient tradition about him, Elagabalus became something of an (anti-)hero in the [[Decadent movement]] of the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq-enc-elagabal&quot;/&gt; He often appears in literature and other creative media as the epitome of a young, amoral [[aesthete]]. His life and character have informed or at least inspired many famous works of art, by Decadents, even by contemporary artists. The most notable of these works include:&lt;ref&gt;For detailed lists of the appearance of Elagabalus in various media, and a critical evaluation of some of these works, see Martijn Icks, ''The Crimes of Elagabalus: The Life and Legacy of Rome's Decadent Boy Emperor'' (London, 2012), 219–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homeopathy''' is a system of [[alternative medicine]] created in 1796 by [[Samuel Hahnemann]], based on his doctrine of ''like cures like'' (''[[similia similibus curentur]]''), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnemann&quot;/&gt; Homeopathy is a [[pseudoscience]] – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific. Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition;&lt;ref name=Tuomela/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baran2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladyman/&gt; large-scale studies have found homeopathy to be no more effective than a [[placebo]], indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to the placebo effect, normal recovery from illness, or [[regression fallacy|regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name=pmid12492603/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquiry_4504/&gt;

Hahnemann believed the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed ''miasms'', and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using a process of [[homeopathic dilution]], in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being bashed against an elastic material, commonly a [[Bookbinding|leather-bound]] book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_6th_128&quot;/&gt; Dilution typically continues well past the point where no [[molecule]]s of the original substance remain.&lt;!-- THIS REF IS THE SAME AS ref name &quot;dynam&quot; --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dynamization and Dilution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynamization and dilution |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine |publisher=[[Creighton University]] Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826082134/http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2002 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Also: &lt;ref name=SmithHM /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;homsim&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Homeopaths select homeopathics&lt;ref name=&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; /&gt; by consulting reference books known as ''repertories'', and by considering the totality of the patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_5th_5+217&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Samuel Hahnemann|Hahnemann S]]|title =[[The Organon of the Healing Art]] |year =1833 |edition=5th |at=aphorisms 5 and 217 |isbn=0-87983-228-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopaths claim that [[Hippocrates]] may have originated homeopathy around 400 BC, when he prescribed a small dose of [[mandrake root]] to treat mania, knowing it produces mania in much larger doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1894.02420900001001|title=Modern Homeopathy and Medical Science|year=1894|last1=Hemenway|first1=Henry Bixby|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|issue=11|pages=367|volume=XXII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the pioneer of pharmacology [[Paracelsus]] declared that small doses of &quot;what makes a man ill also cures him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into German. Being sceptical of Cullen's theory concerning [[cinchona]]'s use for curing [[malaria]], Hahnemann ingested some bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and [[arthralgia|joint pain]]: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat, in accord with the &quot;law of similars&quot; that had been proposed by ancient physicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;UllmanReichenberg-Ullman1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert W. Ullman|author2=Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman|title=The patient's guide to homeopathic medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LColT6LtubcC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=January 24, 2013|date=October 1, 1994|publisher=Picnic Point Press|isbn=978-0-9640654-2-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account of the effects of eating cinchona bark noted by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and published in 1861, failed to reproduce the symptoms Hahnemann reported.&lt;ref name=Holmes /&gt;{{rp|128}} Hahnemann's law of similars is a [[postulate]] rather than a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{cite journal |title= A wail from the waste-basket |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dencos/acf8385.0036.001/1050:349?didno=ACF8385.0036.001;rgn=full+text;view=image |journal=[[Journal of the American Dental Association|The Dental Cosmos]]: a monthly record of dental science |type=editorial |editors=J.

Subsequent scientific work showed that cinchona cures malaria because it contains [[quinine]], which kills the ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' parasite that causes the disease; the mechanism of action is unrelated to Hahnemann's ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atwood-BTTF1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/homeopathy-and-evidence-based-medicine-back-to-the-future-part-i/ | title=Homeopathy and evidence-based medicine: back to the future | publisher=[[Science Based Medicine]] | date=January 4, 2008 | accessdate=September 9, 2013 | last=Atwood |first=Kimball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Provings&quot;====
Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure that would later become known as &quot;homeopathic proving&quot;. These tests required subjects to test the effects of ingesting substances by clearly recording all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haehl1922&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Haehl|title=Samuel Hahnemann: His Life and Work : Based on Recently Discovered State Papers, Documents, Letters, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q80gR6OxDVsC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=January 24, 2013|year=1922|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-7021-693-3|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a collection of provings in 1805, and a second collection of 65 preparations appeared in his book, ''Materia Medica Pura'', in 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirschmann2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Taylor Kirschmann|title=A vital force: women in American homeopathy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSoIGDKsVosC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=January 28, 2013|year=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3320-9|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dynamization and Dilution&quot; /&gt; Hahnemann believed that this process aroused and enhanced &quot;the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_5th_269&quot;&gt;

In the ''Organon'', Hahnemann introduced the concept of &quot;miasms&quot; as &quot;infectious principles&quot; underlying chronic disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClarkeClarke2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= John Henry Clarke |title= Homeopathy explained |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUGIWuo4qc8C&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |date=January 1, 2001 |publisher= Nanopathy |pages=22– |id= GGKEY:JWCD56EF80T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, and thought that initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases. If, however, these symptoms were suppressed by medication, the cause went deeper and began to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;miasms&quot;/&gt; Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly [[Symptomatic treatment|alleviating their symptoms]], as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all &quot;disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann's [[hypotheses]] for the direct or remote cause of all chronic diseases (miasms) originally presented only three, psora (the itch), syphilis (venereal disease) or sycosis (fig-wart disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|edition=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Homoeopathy|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three the most important was ''psora'' (Greek for &quot;itch&quot;), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed [[scabies]], and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnemann_Chronic&quot;&gt;

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as [[genetics]], environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=JW |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it really works |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148–9|date=November 2012}}

===19th century: rise to popularity and early criticism===
Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. It was introduced to the United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Miller | title = America's alternative religions | publisher = State University of New York Press, Albany | date = 1995 | pages = 80 | isbn = 978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the [[American Institute of Homeopathy]], was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States,&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;

From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science.

According to [[:de:Paul Ulrich Unschuld|Paul Ulrich Unschuld]], the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany was fascinated by homeopathy, and spent large sums of money on researching its mechanisms, but without gaining a positive result.

Practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing: ''[[materia medica]]'' and repertories. A homeopathic ''materia medica'' is a collection of &quot;drug pictures&quot;, organized alphabetically. These entries describe the symptom patterns associated with individual preparations.

Homeopathy uses animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its preparations, generally referring to them using [[Latin]] or faux-Latin names. Examples include ''[[arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster snake]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]).

Some homeopaths use so-called &quot;'''nosodes'''&quot; (from the Greek ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16322800&quot;/&gt; Conversely, preparations made from &quot;healthy&quot; specimens are called &quot;sarcodes&quot;.

Some modern homeopaths use preparations they call &quot;imponderables&quot; because they do not originate from a substance but some other phenomenon presumed to have been &quot;captured&quot; by alcohol or [[lactose]].&lt;!--See next two sources, and the rest of the journal issue they came from for more information--&gt; Examples include [[X-ray]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Other minority practices include paper preparations, where the substance and dilution are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, and the use of [[radionics]] to manufacture preparations. Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;

===Preparation===
[[File:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|[[Mortar and pestle]] used for grinding insoluble solids, such as [[platinum]], into homeopathic preparations]]

Hahnemann found that undiluted doses caused reactions, sometimes dangerous ones, so specified that preparations be given at the lowest possible dose. He found that this reduced potency as well as side-effects, but formed the view that vigorous shaking and striking on an elastic surface – a process he termed ''Schütteln'', translated as ''succussion'' – nullified this.&lt;ref&gt;

Serial dilution is achieved by taking an amount of the mixture and adding solvent, but the &quot;Korsakovian&quot; method may also be used, whereby the vessel in which the preparations are manufactured is emptied, refilled with solvent, and the volume of fluid adhering to the walls of the vessel is deemed sufficient for the new batch.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|270|date=January 2015}} The Korsakovian method is sometimes referred to as K on the label of a homeopathic preparation, e.g. 200CK is a 200C preparation made using the Korsakovian method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathy: Diluted out of existence?|url=http://www.scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas/homeopathy-diluted-out-of-existence/|publisher=scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Medicine Potency or Dilution |url=http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp |publisher=ritecare.com |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821064849/http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp |archivedate=August 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluxion and radionics methods of preparation do not require succussion.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|171|date=January 2015}} There are differences of opinion on the number and force of strikes, and some practitioners dispute the need for succussion at all while others reject the Korsakovian and other non-classical preparations.

===Dilutions===
{{Main article|Homeopathic dilutions}}

Three main [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the &quot;centesimal&quot; or &quot;C scale&quot;, diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favoured by Hahnemann for most of his life.

A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in 100, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of 100.

This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern.

In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher &quot;potency&quot;, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_6th_128&quot;&gt;

In Hahnemann's time, it was reasonable to assume the preparations could be diluted indefinitely, as the concept of the atom or molecule as the smallest possible unit of a chemical substance was just beginning to be recognized.

The greatest dilution reasonably likely to contain even one molecule of the original substance is 12C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page 3|title=Alternative Medicine: Homeopathy-A Review|url=http://www.ijopjournal.com/File_Folder/57-69.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Pharmacotherapy |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hahnemann is reported to have joked that a suitable procedure to deal with an epidemic would be to empty a bottle of poison into [[Lake Geneva]], if it could be succussed 60 times.&lt;ref name=Bambridge&gt;

Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a &quot;pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans&quot;,&lt;ref name=Bambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; which is approximately correct.&lt;ref&gt;
A 12C solution produced using [[sodium chloride]] (also called ''natrum muriaticum'' in homeopathy) is the equivalent of dissolving 0.36&amp;nbsp;mL of table salt, weighing about 0.77&amp;nbsp;g, into a volume of water the size of the Atlantic Ocean, since the volume of the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas is 3.55×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 3.55×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;L :

The high dilutions characteristically used are often considered to be the most controversial and implausible aspect of homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=P |title=The Memory of Water: a scientific heresy? |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=141–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17678808 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all homeopaths advocate high dilutions. Preparations at concentrations below 4X are considered an important part of homeopathic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = van Haselen, R. | title = To which extent should potency choice in homeopathy be &quot;regulated&quot;: has European legislation gone too far? | journal = Wien Med Wochenschr. | volume = 155 | issue = 21–22 | pages = 479–81 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16425107 | doi = 10.1007/s10354-005-0231-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally used lower dilutions such as &quot;3X&quot; or &quot;6X&quot;, rarely going beyond &quot;12X&quot;.
The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines.
Those favouring low dilutions stressed [[pathology]] and a stronger link to conventional medicine, while those favouring high dilutions emphasized vital force, miasms and a [[spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of disease.&lt;ref&gt;

===Provings===
A homeopathic &quot;proving&quot; is the method by which the profile of a homeopathic preparation is determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dantas |first1=F |last2=Fisher |first2=P |last3=Walach |first3=H |last4=Wieland |first4=F |last5=Rastogi |first5=D |last6=Teixeira |first6=H |last7=Koster |first7=D |last8=Jansen |first8=J |last9=Eizayaga |first9=J |title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic pathogenetic trials published from 1945 to 1995 |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=4–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17227742 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first Hahnemann used undiluted doses for provings, but he later advocated provings with preparations at a 30C dilution,&lt;ref name = &quot;Organon_6th_128&quot;/&gt; and most modern provings are carried out using ultra-dilute preparations in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain.&lt;ref&gt;

 |isbn= 978-0-443-10160-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the proving process, Hahnemann administered preparations to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a &quot;drug picture&quot;.

The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be &quot;too exciting&quot;, though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Thomas Lindsley|title=The Life and Letters of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann|date=1895|publisher=Boericke &amp; Tafel|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1330001509|pages=103–104|url=https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofdrs00brad|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings are claimed to have been important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

For [[James Tyler Kent]]'s 1905 ''Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica'', 217 preparations underwent provings and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.

Though the proving process has superficial similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different in that the process is subjective, not [[Blind test|blinded]], and modern provings are unlikely to use pharmacologically active levels of the substance under proving.&lt;ref name=Creighton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/science/validity.htm |title=Are the principles of Homeopathy scientifically valid? |publisher=Creighton University School of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not repeatable among different subjects.&lt;ref name=Holmes /&gt;

[[File:Rep1.JPG|thumb|Homeopathic repertory by James Tyler Kent]]

Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. &lt;!--Examination of psychological state may include an inquiry into the content of dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;&quot;Modern Homeopathy And Medical Science&quot;''''', Journal of the American Medical Association, vol 22, March 17, '''1894''', p 367-377, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22law+of+similars%22+definition+ama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bITPMPPwr9&amp;sig=56_xALWwOFWYa4P4BQKj0mjw-eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z7k6TeO1CpC-sQPK2I26Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=similars&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; outdated source, statement can be reintroduced when a better source is found --&gt;The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.&lt;ref name=Stehlin&gt;

From these symptoms, the homeopath chooses how to treat the patient using ''materia medica'' and repertories. In classical homeopathy, the practitioner attempts to match a single preparation to the totality of symptoms (the ''simlilum''), while &quot;clinical homeopathy&quot; involves combinations of preparations based on the various symptoms of an illness.&lt;ref name=pmid12614092/&gt;

===Pills and active ingredients===
[[File:DoseOscillococcinum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Homeopathic pills, homeopathic preparation ''[[oscillococcinum]]'']]

====Isopathy====
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy, invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s. Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the preparations, known as &quot;nosodes&quot;, are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]] or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16322800&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Flower preparations====
Flower preparations can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the physician and homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. Although the proponents of these preparations share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the preparations are claimed to act through the same hypothetical &quot;vital force&quot; as homeopathy, the method of preparation is different. Bach flower preparations are manufactured in allegedly &quot;gentler&quot; ways such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and the preparations are not succussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanhaselen |first1=R |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: A critical appraisal |journal=British Homoeopathic journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052 |doi=10.1054/homp.1999.0308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower preparations being effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title=&quot;Flower remedies&quot;: a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift |volume=114 |issue=23–24 |pages=963–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12635462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Veterinary use====
The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals termed &quot;veterinary homeopathy&quot;, dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.&lt;ref name=Saxton2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saxton |first1=J |title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17227741 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the U.S. In the UK, [[veterinary surgeon]]s who use homeopathy may belong to the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]] and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons.

====Electrohomeopathy====
{{main article|Electrohomeopathy}}
Electrohomeopathy is a treatment devised by Count Cesare Mattei (1809–1896), who proposed that different &quot;colours&quot; of electricity could be used to treat cancer. Popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomeopathy has been described as &quot;utter idiocy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18340908|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=4|issue=1|pages=86–100|pmc=1692573|journal=Medical library and historical journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and efficacy ==

The low concentration of homeopathic preparations, which often lack even a single [[molecule]] of the diluted substance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2005&quot;/&gt; has been the basis of questions about the effects of the preparations since the 19th century. Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of &quot;[[water memory]]&quot;, according to which water &quot;remembers&quot; the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise.&lt;ref name=NatureWhenToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maddox J|title=When to believe the unbelievable |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6176 |page=787 |year=1988 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt; |doi=10.1038/333787a0|bibcode = 1988Natur.333Q.787. |type=editorial }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;delusion&quot;/&gt; [[Pharmacological]] research has found instead that stronger effects of an active ingredient come from [[dose-response relationship|higher]], not lower doses.

=== Plausibility ===

The proposed mechanisms for homeopathy are precluded from having any effect by the laws of physics and physical chemistry.&lt;ref name=GrimesFACT&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grimes | first1 = D.

Homeopaths contend that their methods produce a therapeutically active preparation, selectively including only the intended substance, though critics note that any water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, and homeopaths have not been able to account for a reason why only the selected homeopathic substance would be a special case in their process.&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt; For comparison, ISO 3696:1987 defines a standard for water used in laboratory analysis; this allows for a contaminant level of ten parts per billion, 4C in homeopathic notation.

====Government level reviews====
Government-level reviews have been conducted in recent years by Switzerland (2005), the United Kingdom (2009), Australia (2015) and the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (2017).

The Swiss ''programme for the evaluation of complementary medicine'' (PEK) resulted in the peer-reviewed Shang publication (see ''Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy'') and a controversial competing analysis&lt;ref name=&quot;ShawMisconduct&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.smw.ch/content/smw-2012-13594/ | title=The Swiss report on homeopathy: a case study of research misconduct | author=Shaw, David | journal=Swiss Medical Weekly | date=May 2012 | volume=142 | pages=w13594 | doi=10.4414/smw.2012.13594| pmid=22653406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by homeopaths and advocates led by Gudrun Bornhöft and Peter Matthiessen, which has misleadingly been presented as a Swiss government report by homeopathy proponents, a claim that has been repudiated by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The report &quot;Homeopathy in healthcare: effectiveness, appropriateness, safety, costs&quot; is not a &quot;Swiss report&quot; | author=Gurtner, Felix | journal=Swiss Medical Weekly | date=December 2012 | volume=142 | pages=w13723 | doi=10.4414/smw.2012.13723| pmid=23255156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Government terminated reimbursement, though it was subsequently reinstated after a political campaign and referendum for a further six-year trial period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swissinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations in 2015, in which it concluded that &quot;there were no health conditions for which there was reliable evidence that homeopathy was effective. No good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than placebo, or caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment.&quot;&lt;ref name=NHMRC&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[National Health and Medical Research Council]] |title=NHMRC statement on homeopathy and NHMRC information paper - Evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions |date=2015 |quote=There is no reliable evidence that homoeopathy is effective for treating health conditions. |location=Canberra |publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council |page=16 |isbn=978-1-925129-29-8 |url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/cam02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2017, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) published its official analysis and conclusion on the use of homeopathic products, finding a lack of evidence that homeopathic products are effective, and raising concerns about quality control.&lt;ref name=EASAC2017/&gt;

====Publication bias and other methodological issues====
{{Further information|Statistical hypothesis testing|P-value|Publication bias}}
The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contradiction with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false-positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a [[statistical significance|&quot;statistically significant&quot;]] positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%―a level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sterne2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sterne |first1=JAC |last2=Davey Smith |first2=G |title=Sifting the evidence---what's wrong with significance tests? Another comment on the role of statistical methods |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7280 |pages=226–31 |year=2001 |pmid=11159626 |pmc=1119478 |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7280.226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, trials of low methodological quality (i.e. ones that have been inappropriately designed, conducted or reported) are prone to give misleading results. In a systematic review of the methodological quality of randomized trials in three branches of alternative medicine, Linde ''et al.'' highlighted major weaknesses in the homeopathy sector, including poor randomization.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11416076&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K|authorlink1=Klaus Linde |last2=Jonas |first2=WB |last3=Melchart |first3=D |last4=Willich |first4=S |title=The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials of homeopathy, herbal medicines and acupuncture |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=526–31 |year=2001 |pmid=11416076 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.3.526}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate 2001 systematic review that assessed the quality of clinical trials of homeopathy found that such trials were generally of lower quality than trials of conventional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=WB|last2=Anderson|first2=RL|last3=Crawford|first3=CC|last4=Lyons|first4=JS|title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic clinical trials|journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2001|volume=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1472-6882-1-12|pmid=11801202|pmc=64638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related issue is [[publication bias]]: researchers are more likely to submit trials that report a positive finding for publication, and journals prefer to publish positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sackett |first1=David L. |title=Bias in analytic research |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=32 |issue=1–2 |pages=51–63 |year=1979 |pmid=447779 |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(79)90012-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Robert |title=The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=86 |pages=638–41 |year=1979 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey D.

Positive results are much more likely to be false if the prior probability of the claim under test is low.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16060722&quot; /&gt;

====Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy====
Both [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], which statistically combine the results of several randomized controlled trials, and other [[systematic review]]s of the literature are essential tools to summarize evidence of therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRISMA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberati | first1 = A | last2 = Altman | first2 = DG | last3 = Tetzlaff | first3 = J | last4 = Mulrow | first4 = C | last5 = Gøtzsche | first5 = PC | last6 = Ioannidis | first6 = J PA | last7 = Clarke | first7 = M | last8 = Devereaux | first8 = PJ | last9 = Kleijnen | first9 = J | last10 = Moher | first10 = D | title = The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e1000100 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19621070 | pmc = 2707010 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials evaluating the efficacy of homeopathic preparations in comparison with placebo more often tended to generate positive results, but appeared unconvincing overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;LindeBMC-ComplementAlternMed2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linde | first1 = K | last2 = Hondras | first2 = M | last3 = Vickers | first3 = A | last4 = Ter Riet | first4 = G | last5 = Melchart | first5 = D | title = Systematic reviews of complementary therapies - an annotated bibliography.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evidence of bias [in the primary studies] weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most &quot;original&quot; subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.&lt;ref name=Linde1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K |last2=Scholz |first2=M |last3=Ramirez |first3=G |last4=Clausius |first4=N |last5=Melchart |first5=D |last6=Jonas |first6=WB |title=Impact of study quality on outcome in placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=631–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10391656 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent work by [[John Ioannidis]] and others has shown that for treatments with no prior plausibility, the chances of a positive result being a false positive are much higher, and that any result not consistent with the [[null hypothesis]] should be assumed to be a false positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16060722&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21552759 | volume=45 | issue=3 | title=The role of plausibility in the evaluation of scientific research | author=Almeida RM | journal=Rev Saude Publica | pages=617–20| year=2011 | doi=10.1590/s0034-89102011000300021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic preparation exerts clinical effects different from placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12492603&quot; /&gt;

In 2005, ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]]'s [[Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine|Programme for Evaluating Complementary Medicine]], or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were &quot;compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;shang&quot; /&gt; This was accompanied by an editorial pronouncing &quot;The end of homoeopathy&quot;,&lt;ref name=EndofHomeopathy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=The Lancet |title=The end of homoeopathy |journal=The Lancet |volume=366 |page=690 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67149-8 |issue=9487}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was denounced by the homeopath [[Peter Fisher (physician)|Peter Fisher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher-Lancet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Homeopathy and The Lancet | last=Fisher |first=P | journal=Evid Based Complement Alternat Med | date=March 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=145–147 | doi=10.1093/ecam/nek007 | pmc=1375230 | pmid=16550237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that the most reliable evidence did not support the effectiveness of non-individualized homeopathy. The authors noted that &quot;the quality of the body of evidence is low.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mathie |first=Robert T. |last2=Ramparsad |first2=Nitish |last3=Legg |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Clausen |first4=Jürgen |last5=Moss |first5=Sian |last6=Davidson |first6=Jonathan R.

The results of these reviews are generally negative or only weakly positive, and reviewers consistently report the poor quality of trials. The finding of Linde ''et. al.'' that more rigorous studies produce less positive results is supported in several and contradicted by none.

Some clinical trials have tested individualized homeopathy, and there have been reviews of this, specifically. A 1998 review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=Klaus |last2=Melchart |first2=Dieter |title=Randomized Controlled Trials of Individualized Homeopathy: A State-of-the-Art Review |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=371–88 |year=1998 |pmid=9884175 |doi=10.1089/acm.1998.4.371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled [[odds ratio]] of 1.17 to 2.23 in favour of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded that &quot;the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies.&quot; Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations.&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|209|date=November 2012}} A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that individualized homeopathic remedies may be slightly more effective than placebos, though the authors noted that their findings were based on low- or unclear-quality evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mathie |first=Robert T. |last2=Lloyd |first2=Suzanne M. |last3=Legg |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Clausen |first4=Jürgen |last5=Moss |first5=Sian |last6=Davidson |first6=Jonathan R.

===Explanations of perceived effects===
Science offers a variety of explanations for how homeopathy may appear to cure diseases or alleviate symptoms even though the preparations themselves are inert:&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|155–167|date=November 2012}}
* The [[placebo effect]] – the intensive consultation process and expectations for the homeopathic preparations may cause the effect.
* Therapeutic effect of the consultation – the care, concern, and reassurance a patient experiences when opening up to a compassionate caregiver can have a positive effect on the patient's well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrienRheumatology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.abstract | title=Homeopathy has clinical benefits in rheumatoid arthritis patients that are attributable to the consultation process but not the homeopathic remedy: a randomized controlled clinical trial |author1=Brien S |author2=Lachance S |author3=Prescott P |author4=McDermott C |author5=Lewith G | journal=Rheumatology | date=June 2011 | volume=50 | issue=6 | pages=1070–82 | doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keq234 | pmid=21076131 | pmc=3093927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unassisted [[healing|natural healing]] – time and the body's ability to heal without assistance can eliminate many diseases of their own accord.
* Unrecognized treatments – an unrelated food, exercise, environmental agent, or treatment for a different ailment, may have occurred.
* [[Regression toward the mean|Regression towards the mean]] – since many diseases or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary over time and patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; they may feel better anyway but because of the timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the preparation taken.
* Non-homeopathic treatment – patients may also receive standard medical care at the same time as homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement.
* Cessation of unpleasant treatment – often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient.

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]], a type of [[white blood cell]], released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American [[Scientific misconduct|scientific fraud]] investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were &quot;statistically ill-controlled&quot;, &quot;interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim&quot;, and concluded, &quot;We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;delusion&quot;&gt;

: &quot;My plea is simply for honesty. Let people buy what they want, but tell them the truth about what they are buying.

====Adverse effects====
Some homeopathic preparations involve poisons such as Belladonna, arsenic, and poison ivy, which are highly diluted in the homeopathic preparation. In rare cases, the original ingredients are present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Serious adverse effects such as seizures and death have been reported or associated with some homeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name=sr2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Referring specifically to homeopathy, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:

{{quote|In our view, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses conclusively demonstrate that homeopathic products perform no better than placebos. The Government shares our interpretation of the evidence.&lt;ref name=inquiry_4504&gt;{{cite web |date=February 22, 2010 |title=Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy - Science and Technology Committee |publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/4504.htm |accessdate=April 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with an informed patient choice - which the Government claims is very important - as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm/&gt;}}

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] of the United States' [[National Institutes of Health]] states:

{{quote|Homeopathy is a controversial topic in complementary medicine research. A number of the key concepts of homeopathy are not consistent with fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics. For example, it is not possible to explain in scientific terms how a preparation containing little or no active ingredient can have any effect. This, in turn, creates major challenges to the rigorous clinical investigation of homeopathic preparations. For example, one cannot confirm that an extremely dilute preparation contains what is listed on the label, or develop objective measures that show effects of extremely dilute preparations in the human body.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih-homeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Ben Goldacre]] noted that in the early days of homeopathy, when medicine was [[Heroic medicine|dogmatic]] and frequently worse than doing nothing, homeopathy at least failed to make matters worse:

{{quote|During the 19th-century cholera epidemic, death rates at the London Homeopathic Hospital were three times lower than at the Middlesex Hospital. Homeopathic sugar pills won't do anything against cholera, of course, but the reason for homeopathy's success in this epidemic is even more interesting than the placebo effect: at the time, nobody could treat cholera. So, while hideous medical treatments such as [[blood-letting]] were actively harmful, the homeopaths' treatments at least did nothing either way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldacre: A kind of magic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben |title=A kind of magic? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticized statements by [[George Vithoulkas]] claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]], saying that &quot;The unfortunate layman might well be misled by Vithoulkas' rhetoric into refusing orthodox treatment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The science of homoeopathy, by G.

A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Bristol Homeopathic.jpg|thumb|Hampton House, the former site of [[Bristol Homeopathic Hospital]], one of three Homeopathic Hospitals in [[National Health Service|NHS]].&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm/&gt;]]

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training programme, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, the United Kingdom and [[Luxembourg]]. In other countries, such as Belgium, homeopathy is not covered. In Austria, the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and homeopathy is listed as not reimbursable,&lt;ref&gt;

[[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) Vancouver skeptics participated in a mass overdose outside an emergency room in Vancouver, B.C., taking entire bottles of &quot;medications&quot; that should have made them sleepy, nauseous or dead; after 45 minutes of observation no ill effects were felt. Johnson asked homeopaths and company representatives about cures for cancer and vaccine claims. All reported positive results but none could offer any science backing up their statements, only that &quot;it works&quot;. Johnson was unable to find any evidence that homeopathic preparations contain any active ingredient. Analysis performed at the [[University of Toronto]]'s chemistry department found that the active ingredient is so small &quot;it is equivalent to 5 billion times less than the amount of aspirin ... in a single pellet&quot;.

In March 2016, the [[University of Barcelona]] cancelled its master's degree in Homeopathy citing &quot;lack of scientific basis&quot;, after advice from the Spanish Ministry of Health stated that &quot;Homeopathy has not definitely proved its efficacy under any indication or concrete clinical situation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/03/01/ciencia/1456856774_534268.html|title=La Universidad de Barcelona fulmina su máster de homeopatía|newspaper=El País|date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, in April 2016, the [[University of Valencia]] announced the elimination of its Masters in Homeopathy for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/sociedad/abci-master-homeopatia-universidad-valencia-cancela-edicion-para-proximo-curso-201604072200_noticia.html|title=El Máster de Homeopatía de la Universidad de Valencia cancela su edición para el próximo curso.|publisher=Diario ABC|date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2015 hearing==
On April 20–21, 2015, the FDA held a hearing on homeopathic product regulation. Invitees representing the scientific and medical community, and various pro-homeopathy stakeholders, gave testimonials on homeopathic products and the regulatory role played by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=CFI testimony urges FDA to regulate homeopathic products|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=39|issue=4|pages=6–7|year=2015|publisher=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael de Dora, a representative from the [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI), on behalf of the organization and dozens of doctors and scientists associated with CFI and the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) gave a testimonial which summarized the basis of the organization's objection to homeopathic products, the harm that is done to the general public and proposed regulatory actions:&lt;ref name=fdahearing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM443495.pdf|title=Homeopathic product regulation: evaluating the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory framework after a quarter-century. Testimony of the Center for Inquiry to the Food and Drug Administration|author=De Dora, Michael|publisher=FDA|date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFI testimonial stated that the principle of homeopathy is at complete odds with the basic principles of modern biology, chemistry and physics and that decades of scientific examination of homeopathic products shows that there is no evidence that it is effective in treating illnesses other than acting as a placebo. Further, it noted a 2012 report by the [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] which listed 10,311 reported cases of poison exposure related to homeopathic agents, among which 8,788 cases were attributed to young children five years of age or younger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=1|last1=Mowry|first1=J|last2=Spyker|first2=D|title=2012 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 30th Annual Report|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=51|issue=10|pages=949–1229|year=2013|publisher=Informa|url= https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2012_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf|doi=10.3109/15563650.2013.863906|pmid=24359283}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as examples of harm – including deaths – caused to patients who relied on homeopathics instead of proven medical treatment.&lt;ref name=fdahearing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html|title=What's the harm in homeopathy|publisher=whatstheharm.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFI urged the FDA to announce and implement strict guidelines that &quot;require all homeopathic products meet the same standards as non-homeopathic drugs&quot;, arguing that the consumers can only have true [[Freedom of choice#In economics|freedom of choice]] (an often used argument from the homeopathy proponents) if they are fully informed of the choices. CFI proposed that the FDA take these three steps:
# ''Testing for homeopathic products'' The FDA will mandate that all homeopathic products on the market to perform and pass safety and efficacy tests equivalent to those required of non-homeopathic drugs.
# ''Labelling for homeopathic products'' To avert misleading label that the product is regulated by the FDA, all homeopathic products will be required to have prominent labels stating: 1) the product's claimed active ingredients in plain English, and 2) that the product has not been evaluated by the FDA for either safety or effectiveness.
# ''Regular consumer warnings'' Encouraged by the FDA's recent warning of the ineffectiveness of homeopathic products, CFI urged the FDA to issue regular warning to the consumers in addition to warning during public health crises and outbreaks.&lt;ref name=fdahearing/&gt;

== Official conclusions and recommendations ==

In March 2015, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] of Australia issued the following conclusions and recommendations:&lt;ref name=NHMRC/&gt;
* There is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective for treating health conditions.
* Homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or could become serious.
* People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness.
* People who are considering whether to use homeopathy should first get advice from a registered health practitioner. Those who use homeopathy should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments.

In November 2016, The United States FTC issued an &quot;Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs&quot; which specified that the FTC will hold efficacy and safety claims for OTC homeopathic drugs to the same standard as other products making similar claims.&lt;ref name=FTC2016&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC: Enforcement Policy Statement on Marketing Claims for OTC Homeopathic Drugs|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/996984/p114505_otc_homeopathic_drug_enforcement_policy_statement.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 15, 2016, FTC press release summarized the policy as follows:

:&quot;The policy statement explains that the FTC will hold efficacy and safety claims for OTC homeopathic drugs to the same standard as other products making similar claims. That is, companies must have competent and reliable scientific evidence for health-related claims, including claims that a product can treat specific conditions. The statement describes the type of scientific evidence that the Commission requires of companies making such claims for their products... For the vast majority of OTC homeopathic drugs, the policy statement notes, 'the case for efficacy is based solely on traditional homeopathic theories and there are no valid studies using current scientific methods showing the product's efficacy.' As such, the marketing claims for these products are likely misleading, in violation of the FTC Act.&quot;&lt;ref name=2016PR&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: FTC Issues Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/11/ftc-issues-enforcement-policy-statement-regarding-marketing|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the 2016 FTC Enforcement Policy Statement, the FTC also released its &quot;Homeopathic Medicine &amp; Advertising Workshop Report&quot;, which summarizes the panel presentations and related public comments in addition to describing consumer research commissioned by the FTC. The report concluded:
:&quot;Efficacy claims for traditional OTC homeopathic products are only supported by homeopathic theories and homeopathic provings, which are not accepted by most modern medical experts and do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that these products have the claimed treatment effects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSReport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Medicine &amp; Advertising Workshop Report|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-homeopathic-medicine-advertising-workshop/p114505_otc_homeopathic_medicine_and_advertising_workshop_report.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hair pin''' or '''hairpin''' is a long device used to hold a person's hair in place. It may be used simply to secure long hair out of the way for convenience or as part of an elaborate [[hairstyle]] or coiffure.  The earliest evidence for dressing the hair may be seen in carved &quot;venus figurines&quot; such as the [[Venus of Brassempouy]] and the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. The creation of different hairstyles, especially among women, seems to be common to all cultures and all periods and many past, and current, societies use hairpins.

Hairpins made of [[metal]], [[ivory]], [[bronze]], carved [[wood]], etc. were used in [[ancient history|ancient]] [[Assyria]] and [[Egypt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.11141/ia.42.6.5 Fletcher, J.(2016) The Egyptian Hair Pin: practical, sacred, fatal, Internet Archaeology 42.] Retrieved 30 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; for securing decorated [[hairstyle]]s. Such hairpins suggest, as graves show, that many were luxury objects among the Egyptians and later the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans. Major success came in 1901 with the invention of the [[spiral hairpin]] by [[New Zealand]] [[inventor]] [[Ernest Godward]]. This was a predecessor of the hair clip.

The hairpin may be decorative and encrusted with jewels and ornaments, or it may be utiliarian, and designed to be almost invisible while holding a hairstyle in place.

Some hairpins are a single straight pin, but modern versions are more likely to be constructed from different lengths of [[wire]] that are bent in half with a u-shaped end and a few kinks along the two opposite portions. The finished pin may vary from two to six inches in final length. The length of the wires enables placement in several styles of [[hairdo]]s to hold the style in place. The kinks enable retaining the pin during normal movements.

A hairpin patent was issued to Kelly Chamandy in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent|country= CA|number= 250155|status= patent|title= Hairpin / Épingle à cheveux|pubdate= |gdate= 1925-06-02|fdate= |pridate= |invent1= Kelly Chamandy|invent2= |assign1= |assign2= |class= }} See also {{cite web| title= Hairpin / Épingle à cheveux| url= http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/250155/summary.html| work= Canadian Patents Database| publisher= [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]| date= 2009-03-29| accessdate= 2009-03-30| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114537/http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/250155/summary.html| archivedate= 2007-12-12| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hairpins in Chinese culture==
[[File:Tomb of Prince Chuang of Liang (梁莊王) - Hairpin 1.jpg|thumb|260px|Gold [[Chinese Phoenix|phoenix]] hairpin found in the [[Ming dynasty]] tomb of Prince Chuang of Liang (梁莊王, 1411-1441), 15th century.]]
Hairpins (generally known as {{transl|zh|fa-zan}}; {{zh|髮簪}}) are an important symbol in Chinese culture. In ancient China, hairpins were worn by all genders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Sherrow, Victoria | year=2006 | pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were essential items for everyday hairstyling, mainly for securing and decorating a hair bun. Furthermore, hairpins worn by women could also represent their social status.

In Han Chinese culture, when young girls reached the age of fifteen, they were allowed to take part in a rite of passage known as &quot;{{transl|zh|ji li}}&quot; ({{zh|筓禮}}), or “hairpin initiation” . This ceremony marks the coming of age of young women. Particularly, before the age of fifteen, girls did not use hairpins as they wore their hair in braids, and they were considered as children. When they turned fifteen, they could be considered as young women after the ceremony, and they started to style their hair as buns secured and embellished by hairpins. This practice indicated these young women may now enter into marriage. However, if a young woman hadn't been consented to marriage before age twenty, or she hadn't yet participated in a coming of age ceremony, she must attend a ceremony when she turned twenty.

In comparison with “{{transl|zh|ji li}}”, the male equivalent known as “[[Guan Li|guan li]]” ({{zh|冠禮}}) or “hat initiation”, usually took place five years later, at the age of twenty. In the 21st century Hanfu Movement, an attempt to revive the traditional Han Chinese coming-of-age ceremonies has been made, and the ideal age to attend the ceremony is twenty years old for all genders.

While hairpins can symbolize the transition from childhood to adulthood, they were closely connected to the concept of marriage as well. At the time of an engagement, the fiancée may take a hairpin from her hair and give it to her fiancé as a pledge: this can be seen as a reversal of the Western tradition, such as the future groom presents an engagement ring to his betrothed. After the wedding ceremony, the husband should put the hairpin back into his spouse’s hair.

Hair has always carried many psychological, philosophical, romantic, and cultural meanings in Chinese culture. In Han ethnicity, people call the union between two people “{{transl|zh|jie-fa}}” ({{zh|結髮}}), literally means “tying hair”.  During the wedding ceremony, some Chinese couples exchange a lock of hair as a pledge, while others break a hairpin into two parts, and then, each of the betrothed take one part with them for keeping. If this couple ever get separated in the future, when they reunite, they can piece the two halves together, and this completed hairpin will serve as a proof of their identities as well as a symbol of their reunion. In addition, a married heterosexual couple is sometimes referred to as “{{transl|zh|jie-fa fu-qi}}” ({{zh|結髮夫妻}}), an idiom which implies the relationship between the pair is very intimate and happy, just like how their hair has been tied together.

'''Hate speech''' is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as [[race (human categorization)|race]], religion, [[ethnic origin]], [[sexual orientation]], disability, or gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hate+speech Definitions for &quot;hate speech&quot;], Dictionary.com.

(2nd ed.), Detroit: Macmillan Reference US, pp. 1277–79.

In some countries, a victim of hate speech may seek redress under [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], [[criminal law]], or both. A [[website]] which uses hate speech may be called a ''hate site''. Many of these sites contain [[Internet forum]]s and [[news]] briefs that emphasize a particular viewpoint.

There has been debate over [[freedom of speech]], hate speech and hate speech legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Herz, Michael and Peter Molnar, eds. 2012. ''The content and context of hate speech''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that the term &quot;hate speech&quot; is used to silence critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=27175|title=George Orwell meets the OIC|work=[[Human Events]]|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm caused==
===On the Internet===
On May 31, 2016, [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Twitter]], jointly agreed to a [[European Union]] code of conduct obligating them to review &quot;[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech&quot; posted on their services within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-euhatespeech&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft sign EU hate speech code|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/31/facebook-youtube-twitter-microsoft-eu-hate-speech-code|website=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a campaign which involved the participation of Women, Action and the Media, the [[Everyday Sexism Project]] and the activist Soraya Chemaly, who were among 100 advocacy groups, [[Facebook]] agreed to update its policy on hate speech. The campaign highlighted content that promoted domestic and sexual violence against women, and used over 57,000 tweets and more than 4,900 emails to create outcomes such as the withdrawal of advertising from [[Facebook]] by 15 companies, including [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK|Nissan UK]] and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide UK]]. The social media website initially responded by stating that &quot;While it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#FBrape: Will Facebook Heed Open Letter Protesting 'Endorsement Of Rape &amp; Domestic Violence'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/05/28/fbrape-will-facebook-heed-open-letter-protesting-endorsement-rape-domestic-violence_n_3346520.html|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post UK|date=28 May 2013|author=Sara C Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then agreed to take action on May 29, 2013, after it had &quot;become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rory Carroll&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook gives way to campaign against hate speech on its pages|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/29/facebook-campaign-violence-against-women?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian UK|date=29 May 2013|author=Rory Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory===
{{POV section|date=December 2016}}
According to [[Ritual view of communication|the ritual model of communication]], racist expressions allow minorities to be categorized with negative attributes tied to them, and are directly harmful to them. Matsuda ''et al''. (1993) found that racist speech could cause in the recipient of the message direct, adverse physical and emotional changes.&lt;ref name=Matsuda&gt;[[Mari Matsuda]], Charles R. Lawrence, III, et al., ''Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, and the First Amendment'' (Westview Press 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The repeated use of such expressions cause and reinforce the subordination of these minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvert|first1=Clay|title=Hate Speech and its Harms: A Communication Theory Perspective|journal=Journal of Communication|date=1997|volume=47|pages=4–19|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/store/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02690.x/asset/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02690.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=i12vmye0&amp;s=e911c26285fb4ff28f0fac7c4640140bef7eb823|accessdate=October 9, 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1997.tb02690.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hate speech laws==
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) states that &quot;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 20&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) prohibits all incitement of racism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the debate over how [[freedom of speech]] applies to the Internet, conferences concerning such sites have been sponsored by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/FA869F4E19CCCBC1C1256A570031F062/$File/G0113724.doc?OpenElement ''Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the use of the Internet for purposes of incitement to racial hatred, racist propaganda and xenophobia, and on ways of promoting international cooperation in this area''], Preparatory Committee for the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance, United Nations, 27 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enforcement ===
Hate law regulations can be divided into two types: those which are designed for public order and those which are designed to protect human dignity. Those designed to protect public order require a higher threshold to be violated, so they are not specifically enforced frequently. For example, in Northern Ireland, as of 1992 only one person was prosecuted for violating the regulation in twenty-one years. Those meant to protect human dignity have a much lower threshold to be violated, so those in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands seem to be frequently enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Jeannine|title=Restraining the heartless: racist speech and minority rights.|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=Summer 2009|volume=84|pages=963–79|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=7410&amp;sr=TITLE(Restraining+the+heartless%3A+racist+speech+and+minority+rights)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B2009|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of laws regarding hate speech in the USA can interfere with constitutional rights to freedom of speech. Court rulings often must be reexamined to ensure the U.S. Constitution is being upheld in the ruling on whether or not the words count as a violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Neil|first=Partick M.|date=2016|title=Hate Speech|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/jhueas/hate_speech/0|journal=Encyclopedia of American Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hate speech laws by country==

=== Australia ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in Australia}}
[[Australia]]'s hate speech laws vary by jurisdiction, and seek especially to prevent [[victimisation]] on account of race.

=== Belgium ===
{{Main article|Belgian Anti-Racism Law|Belgian Holocaust denial law}}
The [[Belgian Anti-Racism Law]], in full, the ''Law of 30 July 1981 on the Punishment of Certain Acts inspired by Racism or Xenophobia'', is a law against hate speech and [[discrimination]] passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]] of [[Belgium]] in 1981 which made certain acts motivated by [[racism]] or [[xenophobia]] illegal. It is also known as the ''[[Philippe Moureaux|Moureaux Law]]''.

The Belgian Holocaust denial law, passed on 23 March 1995, bans public [[Holocaust denial]]. Specifically, the law makes it illegal to publicly &quot;deny, play down, justify or approve of the genocide committed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime during the [[Second World War]]&quot;. Prosecution is led by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|Centre for Equal Opportunities]]. The offense is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and fines of up to 2500 [[Euro|EUR]].

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], according to the [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Brazilian Constitution]], [[racism]] is an &quot;Offense with no statute of limitations and no right to bail for the defendant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u107965.shtml &quot;1988 Constitution made racism a crime with no right to bail&quot;], [[Folha de S.Paulo]], 15 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in Canada}}

In [[Canada]], advocating genocide against any &quot;identifiable group&quot; is an indictable offence under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] and  carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.  There is no minimum sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-318.html#h-92 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 318], &quot;Advocating Genocide&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicly inciting hatred against any identifiable group is also an offence.  It can be prosecuted either as an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, or as a summary conviction offence with a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment.  There are no minimum sentences in either case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html#h-92 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 319] [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html &quot;Public incitement of hatred&quot; and &quot;Wilful promotion of hatred&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The offence of publicly inciting hatred makes exceptions for cases of statements of truth, and subjects of public debate and religious doctrine. The landmark judicial decision on the constitutionality of this law was ''[[R. v. Keegstra]]'' (1990).

An &quot;identifiable group&quot; is defined for both offences as &quot;any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-318.html|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|publisher=Legislative Services Branch|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
Article 31 of the &quot;Ley sobre Libertades de Opinión e Información y Ejercicio del Periodismo&quot; (statute on freedom of opinion and information and the performance of journalism), punishes with a large fine those who “through any means of social communication makes publications or transmissions intended to promote hatred or hostility towards persons or a group of persons due to their race, sex, religion or nationality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-34372011000300007&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|title=Alvaro Paúl Díaz, The Criminalization of Hate Speech in Chile in Light of Comparative Case Law (IN SPANISH), Rev. chil. derecho, 2011, vol.38, n.3, pp. 573–609.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This law has been applied to expressions transmitted via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-34372011000300007&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|title=Alvaro Paul Díaz, The Criminalization of Hate Speech in Chile in Light of Comparative Case Law (In Spanish), Rev. chil. derecho, 2011, vol.38, n.3, pp. 573–609.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a rule increasing the penalties for crimes motivated by discriminatory hatred.

=== Council of Europe ===
The [[Council of Europe]] has worked intensively on this issue. While Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] does not prohibit criminal laws against [[historical revisionism (political)|revisionism]] such as denial or minimization of [[genocide]]s or [[crimes against humanity]], as interpreted by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR), the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe went further and recommended in 1997 that member governments &quot;take appropriate steps to combat hate speech&quot; under its Recommendation R (97) 20.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, [https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=1658005&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=582600&amp;Usage=2 Recommendation R (97) 20 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on &quot;Hate Speech&quot;], adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 30 October 1997, accessed 10 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The ECtHR does not offer an accepted definition for &quot;hate speech&quot; but instead offers only parameters by which prosecutors can decide if the &quot;hate speech&quot; is entitled to the protection of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Web of Hate: European, U.S. Laws Clash on Defining and Policing Online Anti-Semitism|work=[[Algemeiner Journal]]|date=February 28, 2013|first=Alina Dain|last=Sharon|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/02/28/a-web-of-hate-european-u-s-laws-clash-on-defining-and-policing-online-anti-semitism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe also created the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], which has produced country reports and several general policy recommendations, for instance against [[anti-Semitism]] and [[wikt:intolerance|intolerance]] against Muslims.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], but Croatian penal code prohibits and punishes anyone &quot;who based on differences of race, religion, language, political or any other belief, wealth, birth, education, social status or other properties, gender, skin color, nationality or ethnicity violates basic human rights and freedoms recognized from international community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:hr:Kazneni zakon#Rasna i druga diskriminacija|Article 174. of Croatian penal code on Croatian Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] prohibits hate speech, and defines it as publicly making statements by which a group is [[:wikt:threaten|threatened]] (''{{lang|da|trues}}''), [[:wikt:insult|insulted]] (''{{lang|da|forhånes}}'') or [[:wikt:degrade|degraded]] (''{{lang|da|nedværdiges}}'') due to race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin, faith or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Penal code, ''Straffeloven'', section 266 B.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
There has been considerable debate over the definition of &quot;hate speech&quot; (''vihapuhe'') in the [[Finnish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/TV2n+Vihaillassa+ei+p%C3%A4%C3%A4sty+yksimielisyyteen+vihapuhe-k%C3%A4sitteest%C3%A4/1135269482946|title=TV2:n Vihaillassa ei päästy yksimielisyyteen vihapuhe-käsitteestä|date=20 September 2011|work=Helsing Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yle-vihailta&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2011/09/vihapuheen_maaritelmasta_ei_yksimielisyytta_2887780.html|title=Vihapuheen määritelmästä ei yksimielisyyttä|date=21 September 2011|work=YLE Uutiset|publisher=YLE|language=Finnish|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &quot;hate speech&quot; is taken to mean ethnic agitation, it is prohibited in [[Finland]] and defined in the section 11 of the penal code, ''War crimes and crimes against humanity'', as published information or as an opinion or other statement that threatens or insults a group because of race, [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]] or conviction, [[sexual orientation]], disability, or any comparable trait. Ethnic agitation is punishable with a fine or up to 2 years in prison, or 4 months to 4 years if aggravated (such as [[incitement]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Finnish Penal code] ''[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Rikoslaki]/Strafflagen'' Chapter 11, section 10 Ethnic agitation / Kiihottaminen kansanryhmää vastaan&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim that, in political contexts, labeling certain opinions and statements &quot;hate speech&quot; can be used to silence unfavorable or critical opinions and suppress debate. Certain politicians, including Member of Parliament and the leader of the [[Finns Party]] [[Jussi Halla-aho]], consider the term &quot;hate speech&quot; problematic because of the lack of an easy definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;yle-vihailta&quot; /&gt;

=== France ===
{{Main article|Hate speech laws in France}}

[[France]] prohibits by its penal code and by its press laws public and private communication which is defamatory or insulting, or which incites discrimination, hatred, or violence against a person or a group of persons on account of place of origin, ethnicity or lack thereof, [[nationality]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], specific [[religion]], sex, [[sexual orientation]], or handicap. The law prohibits declarations that justify or deny crimes against humanity, for example, the [[Holocaust]] ([[Gayssot Act]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loi 90-615 du 13 juillet 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], [[Volksverhetzung]] (&quot;incitement of popular hatred&quot;) is a punishable offense under Section 130 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch]] (Germany's criminal code) and can lead to up to five years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/130.html|title=Strafgesetzbuch §130 (1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups &quot;maggots&quot; or &quot;freeloaders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;StGB §130 (2) 1. c)&lt;/ref&gt; Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the [[Sedition|seditious]] sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's [[Principle of Ubiquity]], Section 9 §1 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch).

On June 30, 2017, Germany approved a bill criminalizing hate speech on social media sites. Among criminalizing hate speech, the law states that social networking sites may be fined up to 50 million euros ($56 million) if they persistently fail to remove illegal content within a week, including defamatory &quot;fake news.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/german-parliament-debates-online-hate-speech-law-48368036|title=ABC News|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iceland ===
In [[Iceland]], the hate speech law is not confined to inciting hatred, as one can see from Article 233 a. in the Icelandic Penal Code, but includes simply expressing such hatred publicly:

: &quot;Anyone who in a ridiculing, slanderous, insulting, threatening or any other manner publicly assaults a person or a group of people on the basis of their nationality, skin colour, race, religion or sexual orientation, shall be fined or jailed for up to 2 years.&quot; ''(In this context &quot;assault&quot; does not refer to physical violence but only to verbal &quot;assault&quot;.)''

Freedom of speech and expression is protected by article 19 (1) of the constitution of India, but under article 19(2) &quot;reasonable restrictions&quot; can be imposed on freedom of speech and expression in the interest of &quot;the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|title=Constitution of India|website=lawmin.nic.in|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
[[Indonesia]] has been a signatory to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] since 2006, but has not promulgated comprehensive legislation against hate-speech crimes. Calls for a comprehensive anti-hate speech law and associated educational program have followed statements by a leader of a hard-line Islamic organization that Balinese Hindus were mustering forces to protect the &quot;lascivious Miss World pageant&quot; in “a war against Islam&quot; and that &quot;those who fight on the path of Allah are promised heaven&quot;. The statements are said to be an example of similar messages intolerance being preached throughout the country by radical clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/hard-liners-targeting-miss-world-in-bali-shows-need-for-anti-hate-speech-law-in-indonesia/ &quot;Hard-Liners Targeting Miss World in Bali Shows Need for Anti-Hate-Speech Law in Indonesia&quot;], Johannes Nugroho, ''Jakarta Globe'', 23 September 2013.

Article 4 of the convention sets forth provisions calling for the criminalization of hate speech.

The Foreign Ministry says that this assessment remains unchanged.&lt;ref name=JusticeMinister-10May2013&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201305100069 &quot;Justice minister criticizes hate speech in Japan but won't punish offenders&quot;], ''The Asahi Shimbun'', 10 May 2013.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930002641/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201305100069 |date=30 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the [[United Nations]] [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (CESCR) warned the Japanese government that it needs to take measures to curb hate speech against so-called &quot;[[comfort women]]&quot;, or Asian women forced into [[sexual slavery]] by the Japanese military during [[World War II]].

The Committee also recommends that the State party educate the public on the exploitation of 'comfort women' so as to prevent hate speech and other manifestations of hatred that stigmatize them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand]] prohibits hate speech under the [[Human Rights Act 1993]]. Section 61 (Racial Disharmony) makes it unlawful to publish or distribute &quot;threatening, abusive, or insulting...matter or words likely to excite hostility against or bring into contempt any group of persons...on the ground of the colour, race, or ethnic or national or ethnic origins of that group of persons&quot;. Section 131 (Inciting Racial Disharmony) lists offences for which &quot;racial disharmony&quot; creates liability.

[[Norway]] prohibits hate speech, and defines it as publicly making statements that threaten or ridicule someone or that incite hatred, persecution or contempt for someone due to their skin colour, ethnic origin, homosexual orientation, religion or philosophy of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-017.html|title=Norwegian Penal code, ''Straffeloven'', section 135 a.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Norwegian Constitution]] guarantees the right to free speech, and there has been an ongoing public and judicial debate over where the right balance between the ban against hate speech and the right to free speech lies. Norwegian courts have been restrictive in the use of the hate speech law and only few persons have been sentenced for violating the law since its implementation in 1970. A public Free Speech committee (1996-1999) recommended to abolish the hate speech law but the [[Norwegian Parliament]] instead voted to slightly strengthen it.&lt;ref&gt;Sindre Bangstad: [http://snl.no/diskriminerende_ytringer diskriminerende ytringer] [[Store norske leksikon]] {{no icon}}, retrieved 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serbia ===
The [[Serbia]]n constitution guarantees [[freedom of speech]], but restricts it in certain cases to protect the rights of others. The criminal charge of &quot;Provoking ethnic, racial and religion based animosity and intolerance&quot; carries a minimum six months prison term and a maximum of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Serbian Penal code, section 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
[[Singapore]] has passed numerous laws that prohibit speech that causes disharmony among various religious groups.  The [[Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act]] is an example of such legislation. The Penal Code criminalizes the deliberate promotion by someone of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different racial and religious groups on grounds of race or religion. It also makes it an offence for anyone to deliberately wound the religious or racial feelings of any person.

In 2011, a South African court banned &quot;Dubula iBhunu (Shoot the Boer)&quot;, a derogatory song degrading Afrikaners, on the basis that it violated a South African law prohibiting speech that demonstrates a clear intention to be hurtful, to incite harm, or to promote hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benesch|first=Susan|title=Words as Weapons|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Spring 2012|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/words-weapons|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, &quot;the draft Hate Crimes Bill was introduced. It aims to address racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and discrimination based on gender, sex, sexual orientation and other issues, by providing an offence of hate crime. It includes controversial provisions that criminalize hate speech in ways that could be used to impermissibly restrict the right to freedom of expression&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/2017-02/POL1048002017ENGLISH.PDF?xMHdSpNaJBUNbiuvtMCJvJrnGuLiZnFU Amnesty International, Report 2016/2017, p. 333].&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation of Economic Education views this bill as a repetition of a mistake done during the time of apartheid as it constitutes &quot;the gravest threat to freedom of expression which South Africans have ever faced&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEE&quot;&gt;Van Staden, Martin.

=== Sweden ===
[[Sweden]] prohibits hate speech, and defines it as publicly making statements that threaten or express disrespect for an ethnic group or similar group regarding their race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin, faith, or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Penal code, [http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Brottsbalken%2C_andra_avdelningen#8_.C2.A7_5 ''Brottsbalken'', chapter 16, section 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.se/404/|title=Page cannot be found|first=Regeringen och|last=Regeringskansliet|date=24 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime does not prohibit a pertinent and responsible debate (''en saklig och vederhäftig diskussion''), nor statements made in a completely [[private sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regeringen.se/404/|title=Sidan kan inte hittas|first=Regeringen och|last=Regeringskansliet|date=1 May 2015|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are constitutional restrictions pertaining to which acts are criminalized, as well limits set by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SupCourtSwe&quot;&gt;[http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/hogstadomstolen/Avgoranden/2005/Dom_pa_engelska_B_1050-05.pdf Judgment of the Supreme Court of Sweden in the Åke Green case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315031313/http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/hogstadomstolen/Avgoranden/2005/Dom_pa_engelska_B_1050-05.pdf |date=15 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime is called ''Hets mot folkgrupp'' in Swedish which directly translated can be translated to ''Incitement (of hatred/violence) towards population groups.''

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]] public discrimination or invoking to rancor against persons or a group of people because of their race, ethnicity, is getting penalized with a term of imprisonment until 3 years or a mulct. In 1934, the authorities of the [[Basel-Stadt]] canton criminalized anti-Jewish hate speech, e.g., the accusation of [[ritual murder]]s, mostly in reaction against a pro-Nazi antisemitic group and newspaper, the [[:de:Volksbund (Schweiz)|Volksbund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edocs.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/volltexte/2008/38044/original/Stimme_409.pdf |title=Basel verbiete jede Diffamierung von Juden und Judentum |date=14 December 1934 |publisher=Die Stimme – Jüdische Zeitung |language=German |format=PDF |accessdate=12 November 2009 |location=Vienna |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719105326/http://edocs.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/volltexte/2008/38044/original/Stimme_409.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], several statutes criminalize hate speech against several categories of persons. The statutes forbid communication which is hateful, threatening, or abusive, and which targets a person on account of disability,  ethnic or national origin, nationality (including citizenship), race, religion, sexual orientation, or  skin colour. The penalties for hate speech include fines, imprisonment, or both.&lt;ref name=&quot;legislation.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2236942|title=Public Order Act 1986|website=www.statutelaw.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1994/33/contents|title=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1998/37/contents|title=Crime and Disorder Act 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2001/24/contents|title=Amendment to Crime and Disorder Act 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2006/1/contents|title=Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 (England and Wales)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2008/4/contents|title=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation against Sectarian hate in Scotland, which is aimed principally at football matches{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}, does not criminalise jokes about people's beliefs, nor outlaw “harsh” comment about their religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/CurrentCommittees/31384.aspx|publisher=The Scottish Parliament|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henrik Ibsen Vanity Fair 1901-12-12.jpg|right|thumb|Ibsen caricatured by SNAPP for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1901]]

'''Henrik Johan Ibsen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|b|s|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ibsen &quot;Ibsen&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-no|ˈhenrik ˈipsn̩|lang}}; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a major [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century]] Norwegian [[playwright]], theatre director, and [[poet]]. He is often referred to as &quot;the father of [[theatrical realism|realism]]&quot; and is one of the founders of [[Modernism]] in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;On Ibsen's role as &quot;father of modern drama,&quot; see {{cite web|url=http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/events/archives/003725.shtml|title=Ibsen Celebration to Spotlight 'Father of Modern Drama'|publisher=Bowdoin College|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=27 March 2007}}; on Ibsen's relationship to modernism, see Moi (2006, 1-36)&lt;/ref&gt; His major works include ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'', ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'', ''[[A Doll's House]]'', ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'', ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', ''[[The Wild Duck]]'', ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', ''[[Pillars of Society]]'', ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'', ''[[Rosmersholm]]'', ''[[The Master Builder]]'', and ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]''. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after [[Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespearetheatre.org/_pdf/first_folio/folio_enemy_about.pdf shakespearetheatre.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.lk/ARKIV/Old_web/ibsen/Ibsen_events_in_Sri_Lanka/Ibsen_launching/|title=Henrik Ibsen – book launch to commemorate the &quot;Father of Modern Drama&quot;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the early 20th century ''A Doll's House'' became the world's most performed play.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie G. Smith, &quot;A Doll's House&quot;, in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'', Vol. 2, p. 81, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's later work examined the realities that lay behind many façades, revealing much that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. The poetic and cinematic early play ''Peer Gynt'', however, has strong [[surrealism|surreal]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Van Den Berg, &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (review), Theatre Journal 58.4 (2006) 684-687&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valency&quot;&gt;Valency, Maurice. The Flower and the Castle. Schocken, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hornby describes him as &quot;a profound poetic dramatist—the best since [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hornby, Ibsen Triumphant, The Hudson Review, Vol. 56, No. 4 (Winter, 2004), pp. 685-691&lt;/ref&gt; He is widely regarded as the most important playwright since Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valency&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/16/stage.asbyatt | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=AS | last=Byatt | title=The age of becoming | date=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[James Joyce]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], and [[Miroslav Krleža]]. Ibsen was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1902, 1903, and 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4435|title=Nomination Database|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen wrote his plays in [[Danish language|Danish]] (the common written language of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Danish language]] was the written language of both Denmark and Norway at the time, although it was referred to as Norwegian in Norway and occasionally included some minor differences from the language used in Denmark. Ibsen occasionally used some Norwegianisms in his early work, but in his later work wrote a more standardised Danish, as his plays were published by a Danish publisher and marketed to both Norwegian and Danish audiences in the original Danish. Cf. {{cite book|last=Haugen|first=Einar|authorlink=Einar Haugen|title=Ibsen's Drama: Author to Audience|year=1979|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-0896-2|page=99|chapter=The nuances of Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were published by the Danish publisher [[Gyldendal]]. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into [[Ibsen (family)|a merchant family]] connected to the [[Patriciate of Norway|patriciate]] of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister [[Sigurd Ibsen]]. Ibsen's dramas continue in their influence upon contemporary culture and film.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Altenburg2.png|thumb|A [[silhouette]] of the [[Johan Andreas Altenburg|Altenburg]]/[[Paus]] family, members of the [[Skien]] [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]], shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. To the right Ibsen's mother [[Marichen Altenburg]], her parents Hedevig Christine {{née}} Paus and ship-owner Johan Andreas Altenburg in the centre, to the left of Hedevig her nephew Henrik Johan Paus, who was not only Marichen Altenburg's cousin, but also the half brother of [[Knud Ibsen]], and who grew up with his uncle and aunt]]

Ibsen was born to [[Knud Ibsen]] (1797–1877) and [[Marichen Altenburg]] (1799–1869), in a well-to-do merchant family, in the small port town of [[Skien]] in [[Telemark]] county, a city which was noted for shipping timber. As he wrote in an 1882 letter to critic and scholar [[Georg Brandes]], &quot;my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien&quot;, explaining that he was closely related with &quot;just about all the [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] families who then dominated the place and its surroundings&quot;, mentioning the families [[Paus]], [[Plesner (Norwegian family)|Plesner]], [[von der Lippe (Norwegian family)|von der Lippe]], [[Cappelen (family)|Cappelen]] and [[Blom (family from Skien)|Blom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibsen.uio.no/BREV_1880-1889ht%7cB18820921GB.xhtml|title=Henrik Ibsens skrifter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haugen (1979: 23)&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen's grandfather, ship captain Henrich Ibsen (1765–1797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner [[Ole Paus (shipowner)|Ole Paus]] (1766–1855), after his mother Johanne, {{née}} Plesner (1770–1847), remarried. Knud Ibsen's half-brothers included lawyer and politician [[Christian Cornelius Paus]], banker and ship-owner [[Christopher Blom Paus]], and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus, who grew up with Ibsen's mother in the Altenburg home and after whom Henrik (Johan) Ibsen was named.

[[File:Hedvig C Paus2.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen's grandmother Hedevig Altenburg, {{née}} [[Paus]] (cf. the character Hedvig in ''[[The Wild Duck]]'')]]
Knud Ibsen's [[Ibsen (family)|paternal ancestors]] were ship captains of Danish origin, but he decided to become a merchant, having initial success. His marriage to Marichen Altenburg, a daughter of ship-owner [[Johan Andreas Altenburg]] (1763–1824) and Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), was a successful match.&lt;ref name=&quot;Templeton&quot;/&gt; Theodore Jorgenson points out that &quot;Henrik's ancestry [thus] reached back into the important Telemark family of Paus both on the father's and on the mother's side. Hedvig Paus must have been well known to the young dramatist, for she lived until 1848.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Jorgenson (1945). ''Henrik Ibsen: life and drama''. Northfield, Minnesota: St. Olaf College Press&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents' &quot;strange, almost incestuous marriage,&quot; and would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

When Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, however, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move permanently to their small summer house, ''Venstøp'', outside of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyers. ''Henrik Ibsen'', Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik's sister Hedvig would write about their mother: &quot;She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and children. She sacrificed herself time and time again. There was no bitterness or reproach in her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Templeton&quot;&gt;Michael Meyers. ''Henrick Ibsen''. Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Bernhard Jaeger, ''Henrik Ibsen, 1828-1888: et literært livsbillede'', Copenhagen, [[Gyldendal]], 1888&lt;/ref&gt; The Ibsen family eventually moved to a city house, Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen's half-brother, wealthy banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Templeton&quot;/&gt;

His father's financial ruin would have a strong influence on Ibsen's later work; the characters in his plays often mirror his parents, and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Templeton&quot;/&gt;

At fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was age 18, a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym &quot;Brynjolf Bjarme&quot;, when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyes. ''Henrik Ibsen.'' Chapters corresponding to individual early plays.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]]. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.

==Life and writings==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2016}}
He spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.

Ibsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]. He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.

His next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Bruce. ''Divine Madness and the Absurd Paradox''. (1990) {{ISBN|978-0-313-27290-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downs, Brian. ''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

With success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the &quot;drama of ideas&quot;. His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Ibsen photographed in Dresden c. 1870]]

Ibsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', first published and performed in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Pillars of Society|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=473|work=ibsen.nb.no|date=10 August 2001|first=Jens-Morten|last=Hanssen|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Doll's House]]'' followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.

''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often &quot;right&quot; than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the [[liberalism]] of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. ''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.

As audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum, including his own.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the &quot;Summons of the Ideal&quot;. Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary &quot;invention&quot;, his wife is earning the household income.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Ibsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the &quot;ideal&quot; is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Handwriting2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator [[Edmund Gosse]]: &quot;30.8.[18]99. Dear Mr. Edmund Gosse! It was to me a hearty joy to receive your letter. So I will finally personally meet you and your wife. I am at home every day in the morning until 1 o'clock. I am happy and surprised at your excellent Norwegian! Your amicably obliged Henrik Ibsen.&quot;]]

Late in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of society's moral values and more to do with the problems of individuals. In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation.  ''Hedda Gabler'' is probably Ibsen's most performed play,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day. ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll's House'' center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character of Nora in ''A Doll's House'', many of today's audiences and theatre critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} feel that Hedda's intensity and drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism on the part of Nora.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Death==
[[File:Henrik Ibsen portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen, late in his career]]
On 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo)&lt;ref&gt;since 2006 [[The Ibsen Museum (Oslo)]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a series of [[stroke]]s in March 1900. When, on 22 May, his nurse assured a visitor that he was a little better, Ibsen spluttered his last words &quot;On the contrary&quot; (&quot;Tvertimod!&quot;). He died the following day at 2:30 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''Ibsen - A Biography'', Doubleday 1971, p. 807&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen was buried in [[Vår Frelsers gravlund]] (&quot;The Graveyard of Our Savior&quot;) in central Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2497|title=Henrik Ibsen (1828 - 1906) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2006, [[The Ibsen Museum (Oslo)|The Ibsen Museum]] in Oslo reopened to the public the house where Ibsen had spent his last eleven years, completely restored with the original interior, colors, and decor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=11150148&amp;subid=0|title=Ibsen.nb.no|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006, the Norwegian government organised the [[Ibsen Year]], which included celebrations around the world. The [[NRK]] produced a miniseries on Ibsen's childhood and youth in 2006, ''[[An Immortal Man]]''. Several prizes are awarded in the name of Henrik Ibsen, among them the [[International Ibsen Award]], the [[Norwegian Ibsen Award]] and the [[Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award]].

Every year, since 2008, the annual &quot;Delhi Ibsen Festival&quot;, is held in [[Delhi]], India,  organized by the Dramatic Art and Design Academy (DADA) in collaboration with The Royal Norwegian Embassy in India. It features plays by Ibsen, performed by artists from various parts of the world in varied languages and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibsen time of the year again - Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art/ibsen-time-of-the-year-again/article1-962902.aspx |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227063726/http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art/ibsen-time-of-the-year-again/article1-962902.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Showcase: Reinventing Ibsen|publisher=The Hindu| url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/showcase-reinventing-ibsen/article4126276.ece |date= 24 November 2012| accessdate = 21 December 2013| location=Chennai, India| first=Swati| last=Daftuar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
[[File:Ibsen monogram.svg|thumb|[[Monogram]] of Henrik Ibsen]]

Ibsen's ancestry has been a much studied subject, due to his perceived foreignness&lt;ref&gt;Johan Kïelland Bergwitz, ''Henrik Ibsen i sin avstamning: norsk eller fremmed?'', [[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]], 1916&lt;/ref&gt; and due to the influence of his biography and family on his plays. Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.

The oldest documented member of the [[Ibsen family]] was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632–1703) from [[Stege, Denmark]]. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a [[Citizen|burgher]] of [[Bergen]] in Norway in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ibsen/norsk_slekt_som_stammer_fra_skipper_Rasmus_Ibsen|title=Ibsen – norsk slekt|author=Terje Bratberg|work=Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains.

Ibsen's biographer [[Henrik Jæger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that &quot;the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane&quot;. This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrik Jæger|Henrik Jaeger]], ''Henrik Ibsen. A Critical Biography'', Chicago: A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergwitz, Joh. K, ''Henrik Ibsen i sin avstamning. Norsk eller fremmed?'', Nordisk forlag, Gyldendalske boghandel, Christiania and Copenhagen, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Ibsen is originally a [[patronymic]], meaning &quot;son of Ib&quot; (Ib is a Danish variant of [[Jacob (name)|Jacob]]). The patronymic became &quot;frozen&quot;, i.e. it became a permanent [[family name]], in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.

The '''Hawaiian language''' (Hawaiian: ''{{lang|haw|{{okina}}Ōlelo Hawai{{okina}}i}}'', {{IPA-haw|ʔoːˈlɛlo həˈvɐjʔi|pron}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries|{{Okina}}ōlelo|id=D15294}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Polynesian language]] that takes its name from [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]], the largest island in the tropical North Pacific [[archipelago]] where it developed. Hawaiian, along with [[English language|English]], is an official language of the [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]]. [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]] established the first Hawaiian-language [[constitution]] in 1839 and 1840.

For various reasons, including [[Hawaii Territory|territorial]] legislation establishing English as the official language in schools, the number of [[first language|native speakers]] of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands. In 2001, native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to under 0.1% of the statewide population. Linguists were unsure that Hawaiian and other [[endangered language]]s would survive.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{Harvcol|Hinton|Hale|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1897 Petition Against the Annexation of Hawaii |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hawaii-petition/ |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, from around 1949 to the present day, there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called [[Pūnana Leo]] were started in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after that. The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers. The federal government has acknowledged this development. For example, the Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 changed the names of several [[national park]]s in Hawai{{Okina}}i, observing the Hawaiian spelling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/s939 Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 (S.939)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the language is still classified as critically endangered by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pidgin]] or [[creole language]] spoken in Hawai{{okina}}i is [[Hawaiian Pidgin]] (or Hawaii Creole English, HCE). It should not be mistaken for the Hawaiian language nor for a dialect of English.

The [[Hawaiian alphabet]] has 13 letters: five vowels (each with a long pronunciation and a short one) and eight consonants, one of which is the glottal stop called [[#Glottal stop |{{okina}}okina]].

==Name==
The Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island, Hawaii (''{{lang|haw|Hawai{{okina}}i}}'' in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer [[James Cook]] and his crew members. They wrote it as &quot;Owhyhee&quot; or &quot;Owhyee&quot;. Explorers Mortimer (1791) and [[Otto von Kotzebue]] (1821) used that spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=44, 459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial &quot;O&quot; in the name is a reflection of the fact that unique identity is predicated in Hawaiian by using a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] form, ''o'', immediately before a proper noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=144, 174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Hawaiian, the name of the island is expressed by saying ''{{lang|haw|O Hawai{{okina}}i}}'', which means &quot;[This] is Hawai{{okina}}i.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cook expedition also wrote &quot;Otaheite&quot; rather than &quot;Tahiti.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling &quot;why&quot; in the name reflects the {{IPA|[hw]}} pronunciation of ''wh'' in 18th-century English (still [[Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩|used]] in parts of the [[English-speaking world]]). ''Why'' was pronounced {{IPA|[hwai]}}. The spelling &quot;hee&quot; or &quot;ee&quot; in the name represents the sounds {{IPA|[hi]}}, or {{IPA|[i]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting the parts together, ''O-why-(h)ee'' reflects {{IPA|[o-hwai-i]}}, a reasonable approximation of the native pronunciation, {{IPA|[o hɐwɐiʔi]}}.

American missionaries bound for Hawai{{okina}}i used the phrases &quot;Owhihe Language&quot; and &quot;Owhyhee language&quot; in Boston prior to their departure in October 1819 and during their five-month voyage to Hawai{{okina}}i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=304, 475}}&lt;/ref&gt; They still used such phrases as late as March 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by July 1823, they had begun using the phrase &quot;Hawaiian Language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hawaiian, ''{{lang|haw|{{okina}}Ōlelo Hawai{{okina}}i}}'' means &quot;Hawaiian language&quot;, as adjectives follow nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=3 ''Figure 1''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and origin==
Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to other [[Polynesian languages]], such as [[Marquesan language|Marquesan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] (the language of [[Easter Island]]), and less closely to [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and  [[Tongan language|Tongan]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

According to Schütz (1994), the [[Culture of the Marquesas Islands|Marquesans]] colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=334–336; 338 ''20n''}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by later waves of immigration from the [[Society Islands]] and [[Samoa]]-[[Tonga]]. Their languages, over time, became the Hawaiian language within the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimura and Wilson (1983) also state: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kimura|Wilson|1983|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Methods of proving Hawaiian's family relationships===
The [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic]] history of the Hawaiian language is demonstrated primarily through the application of [[lexicostatistics]], which involves quantitative comparison of lexical cognates, and the comparative method.&lt;ref name=&quot;lyovin1&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=322–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the number of cognates and the phonological similarity of cognates are measures of language relationship.

The following table provides a limited lexicostatistical data set for ten numbers.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] (PAN) forms are from {{Harvcoltxt|Li|2004|p=4}}.  The Tagalog forms are from {{Harvcoltxt|Ramos|1971}}, the Tongan from {{Harvcoltxt|Churchward|1959}}, and the Hawaiian from {{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The asterisk (*) is used to show that these are hypothetical, [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] forms. In the table, the year date of the modern forms is rounded off to 2000 CE to emphasize the 6000-year time lapse since the PAN era.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Hawaiian cognate is part of the word {{IPA|/ana-hulu/}} ('ten days'); however, the more common word for &quot;10&quot; used in counting and quantifying is {{IPA|/ʔumi/}}, a different root.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Application of the lexicostatistical method to the data in the table will show the four languages to be related to one another, with Tagalog having 100% cognacy with PAN, while Hawaiian and Tongan have 100% cognacy with each other, but 90% with Tagalog and PAN. This is because the forms for each number are cognates, except the Hawaiian and Tongan words for the number &quot;1&quot;, which are cognate with each other, but not with Tagalog and PAN. When the full set of 200 meanings is used, the percentages will be much lower. For example, Elbert found Hawaiian and Tongan to have 49% (98 ÷ 200) shared cognacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points out the importance of data-set size for this method, where less data leads to cruder results, while more data leads to better results.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Application of the comparative method will show partly different genetic relationships. It will point out [[sound changes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
# the loss of all PAN word-final consonants in Tongan and Hawaiian;
# [[Raising (phonetics)#Raised and lowered vowels|lowering]] of PAN {{IPA|*u}} to Tagalog {{IPA|[o]}} in word-final syllables;
# retention of PAN {{IPA|*t}} in word-initial and word-medial position in Tagalog and Tongan, but shift to {{IPA|/k/}} in Hawaiian;
# retention of PAN {{IPA|*p}} in Tagalog, but shift to {{IPA|/f/}} in Tongan and {{IPA|/h/}} in Hawaiian.
This method will recognize sound change #1 as a [[Comparative method#Genetically related languages|shared innovation]] of Hawaiian and Tongan. It will also take the Hawaiian and Tongan cognates for &quot;1&quot; as another shared innovation. Due to these exclusively shared features, Hawaiian and Tongan are found to be more closely related to one another than either is to Tagalog or PAN.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The forms in the table show that the Austronesian vowels tend to be relatively stable, while the consonants are relatively volatile. It is also apparent that the Hawaiian words for &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;8&quot; have remained essentially unchanged for 6000 years.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{for|Hawaiian language history before 1778|#Family and origin}}

===First European contact===

In 1778, British explorer James Cook made Europe's initial, recorded [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] with Hawaiʻi, beginning a new phase in the development of Hawaiian. During the next forty years, the sounds of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (1789), [[Russian language|Russian]] (1804), [[French language|French]] (1816), and [[German language|German]] (1816) arrived in Hawai{{okina}}i via other explorers and businessmen. Hawaiian began to be written for the first time, largely restricted to isolated names and words, and word lists collected by explorers and travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early explorers and merchants who first brought European languages to the Hawaiian islands also took on a few native crew members who brought the Hawaiian language into new territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiians took these nautical jobs because their traditional way of life changed due to plantations, and although there were not enough of these Hawaiian-speaking explorers to establish any viable speech communities abroad, they still had a noticeable presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vanishing Voices|last=Nettle and Romaine|first=Daniel and Suzanne|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=93–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them, a boy in his teens known as [[Henry Obookiah|Obookiah]] (''{{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia''), had a major impact on the future of the language. He sailed to [[New England]], where he eventually became a student at the [[Foreign Mission School]] in [[Cornwall, Connecticut]]. He inspired New Englanders to support a Christian mission to Hawai{{okina}}i, and provided information on the Hawaiian language to the American missionaries there prior to their departure for Hawai{{okina}}i in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=85–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Folk Tales'''

Like all natural spoken languages, the Hawaiian language was originally just an oral language. The native people of the Hawaiian language relayed religion, traditions, history, and views of their world through stories that were handed down from generation to generation. One form of storytelling most commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands is [[hula]]. Nathaniel B. Emerson notes that &quot;It kept the communal imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Unwritten Literature of Hawaii: The Sacred Songs of the Hula |last=Emerson |first=Nathaniel B. |publisher=Washington Government Printing Office |year=1909 |isbn= |location= |pages=7 |quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islanders' connection with their stories is argued to be one reason why Captain James Cook received a pleasant welcome. Marshall Sahlins has observed that Hawaiian folktales began bearing similar content to those of the Western world in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islands of History |last=Sahlins |first=Marshall |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues this was caused by the timing of Captain Cook's arrival, which was coincidentally when the indigenous Hawaiians were celebrating the Makahiki festival. The islanders' story foretold of the god Lono's return at the time of the Makahiki festival.&lt;ref&gt;Kanopy (Firm). (2016). ''Nature Gods and Tricksters of Polynesia.''

===Written Hawaiian===

In 1820, [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] from [[New England]] arrived in Hawai{{okina}}i. 

[[Adelbert von Chamisso]] might have consulted with a native speaker of Hawaiian in Berlin, [[Germany]], before publishing his grammar of Hawaiian (''{{lang|de|Über die Hawaiische Sprache}}'') in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hawaiian King [[Kalākaua|David Kalākaua]] took a trip around the world, he brought his native language with him. When his wife, [[Queen Kapiolani|Queen Kapi{{okina}}olani]], and his sister, Princess (later Queen) [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], took a trip across North America and on to the British Islands, in 1887, Lili{{okina}}uokalani's composition ''[[Aloha Oe|Aloha {{okina}}Oe]]'' was already a famous song in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=7, 169}} example 138, quoting McGuire&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ka Lama Hawaii.gif|thumb|Headline from May 16, 1834, issue of newspaper published by [[Lorrin Andrews]] and students at [[Lahainaluna]] School]]
In 1834, the first Hawaiian-language newspapers were published by missionaries working with locals. The missionaries also played a significant role in publishing a vocabulary (1836)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Andrews|1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; grammar (1854)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Elbert|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dictionary (1865)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Andrews|1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Hawaiian. Literacy in Hawaiian was widespread among the local population, especially ethnic Hawaiians. Use of the language among the general population might have peaked around 1881. Even so, some people worried, as early as 1854, that the language was &quot;soon destined to extinction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of Hawaiian===
The decline of the Hawaiian language dates back to a coup that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and dethroned the existing Hawaiian queen. Thereafter, a law was instituted that banned the Hawaiian language from being taught.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The law cited as banning the Hawaiian language is identified as Act 57, sec. 30 of the 1896 Laws of the Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i:

{{quote|text=The English Language shall be the medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools, provided that where it is desired that another language shall be taught in addition to the English language, such instruction may be authorized by the Department, either by its rules, the curriculum of the school, or by direct order in any particular instance. Any schools that shall not conform to the provisions of this section shall not be recognized by the Department.|source=The Laws of Hawaii, Chapter 10, Section 123&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress 1898 p. 1-PA23&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Congress | first=United States. | title=Congressional Edition | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | issue=v. 3727 | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSxHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA23 | access-date=2017-07-20 | page=1-PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This law established English as the medium of instruction for the government-recognized schools both &quot;public and private&quot;. While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far reaching effects. The banishment was only two years removed from acknowledgement as a legitimate [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] government.  From July 1894 to January 1895, 19 nations, including the United States, recognized Hawai'i as an independent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.angelfire.com/planet/big60/RepublicRecognitionDeJure.html |title=The Republic of Hawaii was given formal diplomatic recognition as the rightful government of Hawaii by at least 19 other nations from July 1894 through January 1895.  Liliuokalani herself proclaimed the Kingdom was finished and swore her oath of loyalty to the Republic.  Also Japan, in April 1897, raised the status of its office in Honolulu from Consulate to Legation (a status not previously accorded during the Kingdom period). |website= Angelfire |access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law stopped short of making Hawaiian illegal (it was still the dominant language spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment and going to the home of the offending child to strongly advise them to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages &quot;in addition to the English language,&quot; reducing Hawaiian to the status of a foreign language, subject to approval by the Department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian [[Kamehameha Schools]]. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the Hawaiian–English Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kawena Pukui, ''Nana i ke Kumu, Vol. 2'' p. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winona Beamer]] was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Harden, ''Voices of Wisdom: Hawaiian Elders Speak,'' p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===1949 to present===
In 1949, the legislature of the Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i commissioned Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert to write a new dictionary of Hawaiian, either revising the Andrews-Parker work or starting from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pukui and Elbert took a middle course, using what they could from the Andrews dictionary, but making certain improvements and additions that were more significant than a minor revision. The dictionary they produced, in 1957, introduced an era of gradual increase in attention to the language and culture.

Efforts to promote the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian-language &quot;immersion&quot; schools are now open to children whose families want to reintroduce Hawaiian language for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Warner|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pūnana Leo|{{okina}}Aha Pūnana Leo]]’s Hawaiian language preschools in [[Hilo, Hawaii]], have received international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Today, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian, which was under 0.1% of the statewide population in 1997, has risen to 2,000, out of 24,000 total who are fluent in the language, according to the US 2011 census. On six of the seven permanently inhabited islands, Hawaiian has been largely displaced by English, but on ''[[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]]'', native speakers of Hawaiian have remained fairly isolated and have continued to use Hawaiian almost exclusively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyovin 1997 258&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the last native speakers of Hawaiian|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-28/last-native-speakers-hawaiian|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramones|first1=Ikaika|title=Niʻihau family makes rare public address|url=http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/niihau-family-makes-rare-public-address|website=http://hawaiiindependent.net|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niʻihau===
{{cquote|Niʻihau is the only area in the world where Hawaiian is the first language and English is a foreign language. Because of many sufficiently marked variations, Niihau people, when visiting or living in Honolulu, substitute the Oahu dialect for their own&amp;nbsp;– apparently easy to do&amp;nbsp;– saying that otherwise people in Honolulu have trouble understanding them. Niihau people speak very rapidly; many vowels and entire syllables are dropped or whispered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; | author=Samuel Elbert and Mary Pukui | source=''Hawaiian Grammar'' (1979)}}

The isolated island of [[Niʻihau]], located off the southwest coast of [[Kauai]], is the one island where Hawaiian is still spoken as the language of daily life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyovin 1997 258&quot;/&gt; 
{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=23}} states that &quot;[v]ariations in Hawaiian dialects have not been systematically studied&quot;, and that &quot;[t]he dialect of Niʻihau is the most aberrant and the one most in need of study&quot;. They recognized that Niʻihauans can speak Hawaiian in substantially different ways. Their statements are based in part on some specific observations made by {{Harvcoltxt|Newbrand|1951}}.

==Orthography ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hawaii]] --&gt;
{{main article|Hawaiian alphabet}}
Hawaiians had no written language prior to Western contact, except for petroglyph symbols.
The modern Hawaiian alphabet, ''ka pī{{okina}}āpā Hawai{{okina}}i'', is based on the [[Latin script]]. Hawaiian words end ''only''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wight|2005|pp=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in vowels, and every consonant must be followed by a vowel. The Hawaiian alphabetical order has all of the vowels before the consonants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=217, 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the following chart.

===Origin===
This writing system was developed by American Protestant missionaries during 1820–1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=98–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first thing they ever printed in Hawai{{okina}}i, on January 7, 1822, and it originally included the consonants ''B, D, R, T,'' and ''V,'' in addition to the current ones (''H, K, L, M, N, P, W''), and it had ''F, G, S, Y'' and ''Z'' for &quot;spelling foreign words&quot;. The initial printing also showed the five vowel letters (''A, E, I, O, U'') and seven of the short diphthongs (''AE, AI, AO, AU, EI, EU, OU'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=110}} Plate 7.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, the developers voted to eliminate some of the letters which represented functionally redundant [[allophone]]s (called &quot;interchangeable letters&quot;), enabling the Hawaiian alphabet to approach the ideal state of one-symbol-one-[[phoneme]], and thereby optimizing the ease with which people could teach and learn the reading and writing of Hawaiian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=122–126; 173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instead of spelling one and the same word as ''pule, bule, pure,'' and ''bure'' (because of interchangeable ''p/b'' and ''l/r''), the word is spelled only as ''pule''.
* Interchangeable B/P. ''B'' was dropped, ''P'' was kept.
* Interchangeable L/R. ''R'' and ''D'' were dropped, ''L'' was kept.
* Interchangeable K/T. ''T'' was dropped, ''K'' was kept.
* Interchangeable V/W. ''V'' was dropped, ''W'' was kept.

However, hundreds of words were very rapidly borrowed into Hawaiian from English, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and Syriac.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyovin 1997 259&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=27, 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these loan words were necessarily [[Hawaiianize]]d, they often retained some of their &quot;non-Hawaiian letters&quot; in their published forms. For example, ''Brazil'' fully [[Hawaiianize]]d is ''Palakila'', but retaining &quot;foreign letters&quot; it is ''Barazila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is ''Gibraltar'', written as ''Kipalaleka'' or ''Gibaraleta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; While {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}} are not regarded as Hawaiian sounds, {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, and {{IPA|[t]}} were represented in the original alphabet, so the letters (''b'', ''r'', and ''t'') for the latter are not truly &quot;non-Hawaiian&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot;, even though their post-1826 use in published matter generally marked words of foreign origin.

===Glottal stop===
{{Main article|ʻokina|l1={{okina}}okina}}
''ʻOkina'' (''{{okina}}oki'' 'cut' + ''-na'' '-ing') is the modern [[Hawaiian name]] for the symbol (a letter) that represents the [[glottal stop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=257, 281, 451}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly known as ''{{okina}}u{{okina}}ina'' ('snap'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

For examples of the {{okina}}okina, consider the Hawaiian words ''Hawai{{okina}}i'' and ''O{{okina}}ahu'' (often simply ''Hawaii'' and ''Oahu'' in English orthography). In Hawaiian, these words can be pronounced {{IPA|[hʌˈʋʌi.ʔi]}} and {{IPA|[oˈʔʌ.hu]}}, and can be written with an {{okina}}okina where the glottal stop is pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=62, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In English, the glottal stop is usually either omitted, or is replaced by a non-phonemic glide, resulting in {{IPA|[hʌˈwai.i]}} or {{IPA|[hʌˈwai.ji]}}, and {{IPA|[oˈa.hu]}} or {{IPA|[oˈwa.hu]}}. Note that the latter two are essentially identical in sound.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbert &amp; Pukui's ''Hawaiian Grammar'' says &quot;The glottal stop, ‘, is made by closing the glottis or space between the vocal cords, the result being something like the hiatus in English ''oh-oh''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Hawaiian Grammar |last=Elbert |first=Samuel H. |last2=Pukui |first2=Mary Kawena |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1979 |isbn= |location=Honolulu |pages=10, 14, 58 |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
As early as 1823, the missionaries made some limited use of the apostrophe to represent the glottal stop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they did not make it a letter of the alphabet. In publishing the Hawaiian Bible, they used it to distinguish ''ko{{okina}}u'' ('my') from ''kou'' ('your').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, [[William DeWitt Alexander]] published a grammar of Hawaiian in which he made it clear that the glottal stop (calling it &quot;guttural break&quot;) is definitely a true consonant of the Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote it using an apostrophe. In 1922, the Andrews-Parker dictionary of Hawaiian made limited use of the opening single quote symbol, called &quot;reversed apostrophe&quot; or &quot;inverse comma&quot;, to represent the glottal stop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schütz 1994 139-141&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent dictionaries have preferred to use that symbol. Today, many native speakers of Hawaiian do not bother, in general, to write any symbol for the glottal stop. Its use is advocated mainly among students and teachers of Hawaiian as a second language, and among linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electronic encoding====
The {{okina}}okina is written in various ways for electronic uses:
* turned comma: '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;&gt;{{okina}}&lt;/span&gt;''', [[Unicode]] hex value 02BB (decimal 699). This does not always have the correct appearance because it is not supported in some fonts.
* opening single quote, a.k.a. left single quotation mark: '''‘''' [[Unicode]] hex value 2018 (decimal 8216). In many fonts this character looks like either a left-leaning single quotation mark or a quotation mark thicker at the bottom than at the top. In more traditional serif fonts such as [[Times New Roman]] it can look like a very small &quot;6&quot; with the circle filled in black: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times New Roman, Times, Garamond;&quot;&gt;'''‘'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

Because many people who want to write the ʻokina are not familiar with these specific characters and/or do not have access to the appropriate fonts and input and display systems, it is sometimes written with more familiar and readily available characters:
* the ASCII apostrophe '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;''', [[Unicode]] hex value 27 (decimal 39),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiipropertytax.com/ |title=Hawaii County Real Property Tax Office |accessdate=2009-03-03 |quote= This site was designed to provide quick and easy access to real property tax assessment records and maps for properties located in the County of Hawaiʻi and related general information about real property tax procedures. }}&lt;/ref&gt; following the missionary tradition.
* the ASCII grave accent (often called [[Grave accent#Computer-related|&quot;backquote&quot; or &quot;backtick&quot;]]) '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pipwerks.com/journal/2009/02/22/hawaiian-diacriticals/ |title=Hawaiian diacriticals |accessdate=2009-03-03 |quote=Over the last decade, there has been an attempt by many well-meaning locals (Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian) to use substitute characters when true diacriticals aren't available. ... This brings me to one of my pet peeves and the purpose of this post: misuse of the backtick (`) character. Many of the previously-mentioned well-intentioned folks mistakenly use a backtick to represent an ʻokina, and it drives me absolutely bonkers. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302152356/http://pipwerks.com/journal/2009/02/22/hawaiian-diacriticals/ |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unicode]] hex value 60 (decimal 96)

===Macron===
A modern Hawaiian name for the [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] symbol is ''kahakō'' (''kaha'' 'mark' + ''kō'' 'long').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=109, 110, 156, 478}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly known as ''mekona'' (Hawaiianization of ''macron''). It can be written as a [[diacritic|diacritical mark]] which looks like a hyphen or dash written above a vowel, i.e., ''ā ē ī ō ū'' and ''Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū''. It is used to show that the marked vowel is a &quot;double&quot;, or &quot;geminate&quot;, or &quot;long&quot; vowel, in phonological terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbert 1979 14-15&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Vowel length]])

As early as 1821, at least one of the missionaries, [[Hiram Bingham I|Hiram Bingham]], was using macrons (and breves) in making handwritten transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=139, 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missionaries specifically requested their sponsor in [[Boston]] to send them some type (fonts) with accented vowel characters, including vowels with macrons, but the sponsor made only one response and sent the wrong font size (pica instead of small pica).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schütz 1994 139-141&quot;/&gt; Thus, they could not print ā, ē, ī, ō, nor ū (at the right size), even though they wanted to.

===Pronunciation===
Due to extensive [[allophony]], Hawaiian has more than 13 [[phone (phonetics)|phones]]. Although vowel length is phonemic, long vowels are not always pronounced as such,&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbert 1979 14-15&quot;/&gt; even though under the rules for assigning stress in Hawaiian, a long vowel will always receive stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=14, 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiian is known for having very few [[consonant]] phonemes&amp;nbsp;– eight: {{IPA|/p, k ~ t, ʔ, h, m, n, l, w ~ v/}}. It is notable that Hawaiian has allophonic variation of {{IPA|[t]}} with {{IPA|[k]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbert 1979 22-25&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kinney|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Newbrand|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|[w]}} with {{IPA|[v]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in some dialects) {{IPA|[l]}} with {{IPA|[n]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IPA|[t]}}–{{IPA|[k]}} variation is quite unusual among the world's languages, and is likely a product both of the small number of consonants in Hawaiian, and the recent shift of historical *t to modern {{IPA|[t]}}–{{IPA|[k]}}, after historical *k had shifted to {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. In some dialects, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} remains as {{IPA|[k]}} in some words. These variations are largely free, though there are conditioning factors. {{IPA|/l/}} tends to {{IPA|[n]}} especially in words with both {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, such as in the island name ''Lāna{{okina}}i'' ({{IPA|[laːˈnɐʔi]}}–{{IPA|[naːˈnɐʔi]}}), though this is not always the case: ''{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele'' or ''{{okina}}ene{{okina}}ene'' &quot;black&quot;. The {{IPA|[k]}} allophone is almost universal at the beginnings of words, whereas {{IPA|[t]}} is most common before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|[v]}} is also the norm after {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|[w]}} is usual after {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. After {{IPA|/a/}} and initially, however, {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[v]}} are in free variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;A consonant occurs only before a vowel; thus two consonants never occur in succession and a syllable always ends with a vowel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Vowels===
Hawaiian has five [[Vowel length|short]] and five [[Vowel length|long]] [[vowel]]s, plus [[diphthong]]s.

Hawaiian has five pure vowels.  The short vowels are {{IPA|/u, i, o, e, a/}}, and the long vowels, if they are considered separate phonemes rather than simply sequences of like vowels, are {{IPA|/uː, iː, oː, eː, aː/}}. When stressed, short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} tend to become {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, while when unstressed they are {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ə]}}. {{IPA|/e/}} also tends to become {{IPA|[ɛ]}} next to {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and another {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, as in ''Pele'' {{IPA|[pɛlɛ]}}. Some grammatical particles vary between short and long vowels. These include ''a'' and ''o'' &quot;of&quot;, ''ma'' &quot;at&quot;, ''na'' and ''no'' &quot;for&quot;. Between a back vowel {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} and a following non-back vowel ({{IPA|/a e i/}}), there is an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|[w]}}, which is generally not written. Between a front vowel {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} and a following non-front vowel ({{IPA|/a o u/}}), there is an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|[j]}} (a ''y'' sound), which is never written.

The short-vowel diphthongs are {{IPA|/iu, ou, oi, eu, ei, au, ai, ao, ae/}}. In all except perhaps {{IPA|/iu/}}, these are [[falling diphthong]]s. However, they are not as tightly bound as the diphthongs of English, and may be considered vowel sequences. (The second vowel in such sequences may receive the stress, but in such cases it is not counted as a diphthong.) In fast speech, {{IPA|/ai/}} tends to {{IPA|[ei]}} and {{IPA|/au/}} tends to {{IPA|[ou]}}, conflating these diphthongs with {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}}.

There are only a limited number of vowels which may follow long vowels, and some authors treat these sequences as diphthongs as well: {{IPA|/oːu, eːi, aːu, aːi, aːo, aːe/}}.

===Phonotactics===
[[Hawaiian phonology#Phonotactics|Hawaiian syllable structure]] is (C)V. All CV syllables occur except for ''wū'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986}} see Hawaiian headwords.&lt;/ref&gt; ''wu'' occurs only in two words borrowed from English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=29 ''4n''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown by Schütz,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyovin 1997 259&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=xvii-xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaiian phonology#Stress|Hawaiian word-stress]] is predictable in words of one to four syllables, but not in words of five or more syllables. [[Hawaiian phonology#Phonological processes|Hawaiian phonological processes]] include palatalization and deletion of consonants, as well as raising, diphthongization, deletion, and compensatory lengthening of vowels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbert 1979 22-25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kinney|1956}})&lt;/ref&gt; Phonological reduction (or &quot;decay&quot;) of consonant phonemes during the historical development of the language has resulted in the phonemic glottal stop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Louis Stevenson]], ''In the South Seas'', 1891 page 12, quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1996 373&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimate loss ([[deletion (phonology)|deletion]]) of intervocalic consonant phonemes has resulted in Hawaiian long vowels and diphthongs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1996 373&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=164, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=107–108}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Hawaiian grammar}}
Hawaiian is an [[analytic language]] with [[verb–subject–object]] word order. While there is no use of [[inflection]] for verbs, in Hawaiian, like other [[Austronesian personal pronouns]],  [[declension]] is found in the differentiation between a- and o-class [[genitive case]] personal pronouns in order to indicate [[inalienable possession]] in a binary possessive class system. Also like many Austronesian languages, Hawaiian pronouns employ separate words for [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive we]] (clusivity), and distinguish [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. The grammatical function of verbs is marked by adjacent [[grammatical particle|particles]] (short words) and by their relative positions, that indicate [[tense–aspect–mood]].

Some examples of verb phrase patterns:
* ''ua'' {{sc|verb}} – [[perfective]]
* ''e'' {{sc|verb}} ''ana'' – [[imperfective]]
* ''ke'' {{sc|verb}} ''nei'' – [[present progressive]]
* ''e'' {{sc|verb}} – [[imperative mood|imperative]]
* ''mai'' {{sc|verb}} – negative imperative
* ''i'' {{sc|verb}} – purposive
* ''ke'' {{sc|verb}} – infinitive
[&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;]

Nouns can be marked with [[article (grammar)|articles]]:
* ''ka honu'' (the turtle)
* ''nā honu'' (the turtles)
* ''ka hale'' (the house)
* ''ke kanaka'' (the person)

''ka'' and ''ke'' are singular definite articles. ''ke'' is used before words beginning with a-, e-, o- and k-, and with some words beginning {{okina}}- and p-. ''ka'' is used in all other cases. ''nā'' is the plural definite article.

To show part of a group, the word ''kekahi'' is used. To show a bigger part, ''mau'' is inserted to pluralize the subject.

Examples:
* ''kekahi pipi'' (one of the cows)
* ''kekahi mau pipi'' (some of the cows)

The '''Second Polish Republic''', commonly known as '''[[Interwar period|interwar]] Poland''', refers to the country of [[Poland]] between the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s (1918–1939). Officially known as the '''Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]] Polska}}), the Polish state was [[Polish Independence Day|recreated in 1918]], in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were fixed in 1922, Poland's neighbours were [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the [[Free City of Danzig]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. It had access to the [[Baltic Sea]] via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of [[Gdynia]]. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-[[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungarian]] governorate of [[Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II|Subcarpathia]]. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when [[Invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovak Republic]], marking the beginning of [[World War II in Europe]]. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the [[Poland|current Polish state]] as it included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west.

The Second Republic's land area was 388,634&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, making it, in October 1938, the sixth largest country in Europe. After the [[Teschen conflict|annexation]] of [[Zaolzie]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], this grew to 389,720&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. According to the [[Polish census of 1921|1921 census]], the number of inhabitants was 27.2 million. By 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, this had grown to an estimated 35.1 million. Almost a third of population came from [[minority group]]s: 13.9% [[Ukrainians]]; 10% [[Jew]]s; 3.1% [[Belarusians]]; 2.3% [[Germans]] and 3.4% [[Czechs]], [[Lithuanians]] and [[Russians]]. At the same time, a significant number of ethnic Poles lived [[Polish diaspora|outside the country borders]]. The Republic endured and expanded, despite a variety of difficulties in the [[aftermath of World War I]], including conflicts [[Polish–Ukrainian War|with the Ukrainians]], [[Polish–Czechoslovak War|Czechoslovakia]], [[Polish–Lithuanian War|Lithuania]], [[Polish–Soviet War|Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine]]; the [[Weimar Republic]] [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–19)|over Greater Poland]], [[Silesian Uprisings|and Upper Silesia]]; and in spite of increasing hostility from [[Nazi Germany]].

Poland maintained a slow (see: [[German–Polish customs war|trade embargo]]) but steady level of economic development. The cultural hubs of interwar Poland{{spaced ndash}}[[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]], [[Poznań]], [[Vilnius|Wilno]] and [[Lviv|Lwów]]{{spaced ndash}}became major European cities and the sites of internationally acclaimed universities and other institutions of higher education. By 1939, the Republic had become &quot;one of Europe's major powers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;

=== End of World War I ===
In the course of World War I (1914-1918), [[Second Reich|Germany]] gradually gained overall dominance on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] as the [[Imperial Russian Army]] fell back. German and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] armies seized the [[Congress Poland|Russian-ruled part of what became Poland]]. In a failed attempt to resolve the [[Polish question]] as quickly as possible, Berlin set up a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–18)|German puppet state]] on 5 November 1916, with a governing [[Provisional Council of State]] and (from 15 October 1917) a [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] (''Rada Regencyjna Królestwa Polskiego''). The Council administered the country under German auspices (see also [[Mitteleuropa]]), pending [[Royal elections in Poland|the election of a king]]. A month before Germany surrendered on 11 November 1918 and the war ended, the Regency Council had dissolved the [[Council of State]], and announced its intention to restore Polish independence (7 October 1918).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} With the notable exception of the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-oriented [[Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (''SDKPiL''), most Polish political parties supported this move. On 23 October the Regency Council appointed a new government under [[Józef Świeżyński]] and began conscription into the [[Polish Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Watt, ''Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate, 1918–1939'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of the Republic ===
[[File:RzeczpospolitaII.png|thumb|300px|Second Polish Republic between 1921 and 1939 (light beige), including the [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]] (''Kresy'')]]

In 1918–1919, over 100 [[Workers' Councils in Poland|workers' councils]] sprang up on Polish territories;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Rady-Delegatow-Robotniczych-w-Polsce;3965576.html|title= Rady Delegatów Robotniczych w Polsce|publisher= Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|accessdate= July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 November 1918, in [[Lublin]], the first [[Soviet of Delegates]] was established. On 6 November socialists proclaimed the [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]] at Tarnobrzeg in Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. The same day the Socialist, [[Ignacy Daszyński]], set up a [[Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Tymczasowy Rząd Ludowy Republiki Polskiej'') in Lublin. On Sunday, 10 November at 7 a.m., [[Józef Piłsudski]], newly freed from 16 months in a German prison in [[Magdeburg]], returned by train to Warsaw. Piłsudski, together with Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], was greeted at Warsaw's railway station by Regent [[Zdzisław Lubomirski]] and by Colonel [[Adam Koc]]. Next day, due to his popularity and support from most political parties, the Regency Council appointed Piłsudski as Commander in Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 14 November, the Council dissolved itself and transferred all its authority to Piłsudski as Chief of State (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]''). After consultation with Piłsudski, Daszyński's government dissolved itself and a new government formed under [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]]. In 1918 Italy became the first country in Europe to recognise Poland's renewed sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Garlicki (1995), ''Józef Piłsudski, 1867–1935''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polish-soviet war 1920 Polish defences near Milosna, August.jpg|left|thumb|Polish defences at [[Miłosna, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Miłosna]], during the decisive [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|battle of Warsaw]], August 1920.]]

Centers of government that formed at that time in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (formerly Austrian-ruled southern Poland) included the National Council of the [[Principality of Cieszyn]] (established in November 1918), the [[Republic of Zakopane]] and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] (28 October). Soon afterward, the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] broke out in [[Lwów]] (1 November 1918) between forces of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Military Committee of Ukrainians]] and the Polish irregular units made up of students known as the [[Lwów Eaglets]], who were later supported by the Polish Army (see [[Battle of Lwów (1918)]], [[Battle of Przemyśl (1918)]]). Meanwhile, in western Poland, another war of national liberation began under the banner of the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–19)]]. In January 1919 [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakian]] forces attacked Polish units in the area of Zaolzie (see [[Polish–Czechoslovak War]]). Soon afterwards the [[Polish–Lithuanian War]] (ca 1919-1920) began, and in August 1919 Polish-speaking residents of [[Upper Silesia]] initiated a series of three [[Silesian Uprisings]]. The most critical military conflict of that period, however, the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919-1921), ended in a decisive Polish victory.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Richard Davies, ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20'' (2nd ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 the Warsaw government suppressed the Republic of Tarnobrzeg and the workers' councils.

== Politics and government ==
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Józef Piłsudski]], [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'')]] between November 1918 and December 1922]]

The Second Polish Republic was a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] from 1919 (see [[Small Constitution of 1919]]) to 1926, with the [[President of Poland|President]] having limited powers. The [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|Parliament]] elected him, and he could appoint the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] as well as the government with the [[Sejm]]'s (lower house's) approval, but he could only dissolve the Sejm with the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senate]]'s consent. Moreover, his power to pass decrees was limited by the requirement that the Prime Minister and the appropriate other Minister had to verify his decrees with their signatures. Poland was one of the first countries in the world to recognize [[women's suffrage]]. Women in Poland were granted the right to vote on 28 November 1918 by a decree of Józef Piłsudski.&lt;ref&gt;A. Polonsky, ''Politics in Independent Poland, 1921–1939: The Crisis of Constitutional Government'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The major political parties at this time were the [[Polish Socialist Party]], [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], various [[People's Party (Poland)|Peasant Parties]], [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]], and political groups of ethnic minorities (German: [[German Social Democratic Party of Poland]], Jewish: [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland]], [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]], and Ukrainian: [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]]). Frequently changing governments (see [[Polish legislative election, 1919]], [[Polish legislative election, 1922]]) and other negative publicity the politicians received (such as accusations of corruption or [[1919 Polish coup attempt]]), made them increasingly unpopular. Major politicians at this time, in addition to Piłsudski, included peasant activist [[Wincenty Witos]] (Prime Minister three times) and right-wing leader [[Roman Dmowski]]. Ethnic minorities were represented in the [[Sejm]]; e.g. in 1928 – 1930 there was the Ukrainian-Belarusian Club, with 26 Ukrainian and 4 Belarusian members.
[[File:Czolg zamach majowy.jpg|thumb|left|[[May Coup (Poland)|The May Coup d'État]] (1926)]]

After the Polish – Soviet war, Marshal Piłsudski led an intentionally modest life, writing historical books for a living. After he took power by a [[May Coup (Poland)|military coup]] in May 1926, he emphasized that he wanted to heal the Polish society and politics of excessive partisan politics. His regime, accordingly, was called [[Sanation|Sanacja]] in Polish. The [[Polish legislative election, 1928|1928 parliamentary elections]] were still considered free and fair, although the pro-Piłsudski [[Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] won them. The following three parliamentary elections (in [[Polish legislative election, 1930|1930]], [[Polish legislative election, 1935|1935]] and [[Polish legislative election, 1938|1938]]) were manipulated, with opposition activists sent to [[Bereza Kartuska prison]] (see also [[Brest trials]]). As a result, pro-government party [[Camp of National Unity]] won huge majorities in them. Piłsudski died just after an [[April Constitution of Poland|authoritarian constitution]] was approved in the spring of 1935. During the last four years of the Second Polish Republic, the major politicians included President [[Ignacy Mościcki]], Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]] and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Polish Army]], [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]]. The country was divided into [[Electoral districts of Poland (1935–1939)|104 electoral districts]], and those politicians who were forced to leave Poland, founded [[Front Morges]] in 1936. The government that ruled Second Polish Republic in its final years is frequently referred to as [[Piłsudski's colonels]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hetherington, ''Unvanquished: Joseph Piłsudski, Resurrected Poland, and the Struggle for Eastern Europe'' (2012); W.

=== Military ===
[[File:PZL-37 Los.jpg|thumb|right|[[PZL.37 Łoś]] was a Polish twin-engine [[medium bomber]]]]

The interwar Poland had a considerably large army of 283,000 soldiers on active duty: in 37 infantry divisions, 11 cavalry brigades, and two armored brigades, plus artillery units. Another 700,000 men served in the reserves. At the outbreak of the war, the Polish army was able to put in the field almost one million soldiers, 2,800 guns, 500 tanks and 400 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= David G.

The training of the [[Polish army]] was thorough. The N.C.O.s were a competent body of men with expert knowledge and high ideals. The officers, both senior and junior, constantly refreshed their training in the field and in the lecture-hall, where modern technical achievement and the lessons of contemporary wars were demonstrated and discussed. The equipment of the Polish army was less developed technically than that of the enemy and its rearmament was slowed down by a recrudescence of optimism in western Europe and the usual budget difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Walter M. Drzewieniecki,&quot;The Polish Army on the Eve of World War II,&quot; ''Polish Review'' (1981) 26#3 pp 54–64 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25777834 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

After regaining its independence, Poland was faced with major economic difficulties. In addition to the devastation wrought by World War I, the exploitation of the Polish economy by the German and Russian occupying powers, and the sabotage performed by retreating armies, the new republic was faced with the task of economically unifying disparate economic regions, which had previously been part of different countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolf&quot;/&gt; Within the borders of the Republic were the remnants of three different economic systems, with five different currencies (the [[German mark]], the [[Russian ruble]], the [[Austrian crown]], the [[Polish marka]] and the [[German ostruble|Ostrubel]])&lt;ref name=wolf/&gt; and with little or no direct infrastructural links. The situation was so bad that neighboring industrial centers as well as major cities lacked direct railroad links, because they had been parts of different nations. For example, there was no direct railroad connection between Warsaw and Kraków until 1934. This situation was described by [[Melchior Wańkowicz]] in his book [[Sztafeta]].

On top of this was the massive destruction left after both World War I and the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. There was also a great economic disparity between the [[Kresy Wschodnie|eastern]] (commonly called ''Poland B'') and western (called ''Poland A'') parts of the country, with the western half, especially areas that had belonged to the [[German Empire]] being much more developed and prosperous. Frequent border closures and a [[German–Polish customs war|customs war]] with Germany also had negative economic impacts on Poland. In 1924 Prime Minister and Economic Minister [[Władysław Grabski]] introduced the [[złoty]] as a single common currency for Poland (it replaced the [[Polish marka]]), which remained a stable currency. The currency helped Poland to control the massive hyperinflation. It was the only country in Europe able to do this without foreign loans or aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;onet&quot;/&gt; The average annual growth rate ([[GDP per capita]]) was 5.24% in 1920–29 and 0.34% in 1929–38.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadberry&quot;&gt;Stephen Broadberry, Kevin H.

Hostile relations with neighbours were a major problem for the economy of interbellum Poland. In the year 1937, [[foreign trade]] with all neighbours amounted to only 21% of Poland's total. Trade with Germany, Poland's most important neighbour, accounted for 14.3% of Polish exchange. Foreign trade with the Soviet Union (0.8%) was virtually nonexistent. Czechoslovakia accounted for 3.9%, Latvia for 0.3%, and Romania for 0.8%. By mid-1938, after the [[Anschluss]] of Austria, Greater Germany was responsible for as much as 23% of Polish foreign trade.

The basis of Poland's gradual recovery after the [[Great Depression]] was its mass economic development plans (see [[Four Year Plan (Poland)|Four Year Plan]]), which oversaw the building of three key infrastructural elements. The first was the establishment of the [[Gdynia]] seaport, which allowed Poland to completely bypass [[Free City of Danzig|Gdańsk]] (which was under heavy German pressure to boycott Polish coal exports). The second was construction of the 500-kilometer rail connection between [[Upper Silesia]] and Gdynia, called [[Polish Coal Trunk-Line]], which served freight trains with coal. The third was the creation of a central industrial district, named ''COP – Central Industrial Region'' ([[Centralny Okręg Przemysłowy]]). Unfortunately, these developments were interrupted and largely destroyed by the German and Soviet invasion and the start of World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHP&quot;/&gt; Other achievements of interbellum Poland included [[Stalowa Wola]] (a brand new city, built in a forest around a steel mill), [[Mościce]] (now a district of [[Tarnów]], with a large nitrate factory), and the creation of a central [[Bank of Poland|bank]]. There were several trade fairs, with the most popular being [[Poznań International Fair]], Lwów's [[Targi Wschodnie]], and Wilno's [[Targi Północne]]. [[Polish Radio]] had ten stations (see [[Radio stations in interwar Poland]]), with the eleventh one planned to be opened in the autumn of 1939. Furthermore, in 1935 Polish engineers began working on the TV services. By early 1939, experts of the Polish Radio built four TV sets. The first movie broadcast by experimental Polish TV was [[Barbara Radziwiłłówna (film)|Barbara Radziwiłłówna]], and by 1940, regular TV service was scheduled to begin operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvp.info/informacje/nauka/70-lat-telewizji-w-polsce/862059 70 years of television in Poland, TVP INFO, 26.08.2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interbellum Poland was also a country with numerous social problems. Unemployment was high, and poverty was widespread, which resulted in several cases of social unrest, such as the [[1923 Kraków riot]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland]]. There were conflicts with national minorities, such as [[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia (1930)]], relations with Polish neighbors were sometimes complicated (see [[Soviet raid on Stołpce]], [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts]], [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania]]). On top of this, there were natural disasters, such as [[1934 flood in Poland]].

===Major industrial centers===

Interbellum, Poland was unofficially divided into two parts – better developed &quot;Poland A&quot; in the west, and underdeveloped &quot;Poland B&quot; in the east. Polish industry was concentrated in the west, mostly in Polish [[Upper Silesia]], and the adjacent [[Lesser Poland]]'s province of [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], where the bulk of coal mines and steel plants was located. Furthermore, heavy industry plants were located in [[Częstochowa]] (''Huta Częstochowa'', founded in 1896), [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]] (''Huta Ostrowiec'', founded in 1837–1839), [[Stalowa Wola]] (brand new industrial city, which was built from scratch in 1937 – 1938), [[Chrzanów]] (''[[Fablok]]'', founded in 1919), [[Jaworzno]], [[Trzebinia]] (oil refinery, opened in 1895), [[Łódź]] (the seat of Polish textile industry), [[Poznań]] ([[H. Cegielski – Poznań]]), Kraków and Warsaw ([[Ursus Factory]]). Further east, in [[Kresy]], industrial centers included two major cities of the region – Lwów and Wilno ([[Elektrit]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;liberte.pl&quot;/&gt;

Besides coal mining, Poland also had deposits of oil in [[Boryslav|Borysław]], [[Drohobych|Drohobycz]], [[Jasło]] and [[Gorlice]] (see [[Polmin]]), potassium salt ([[TESP (company)|TESP]]), and [[basalt]] ([[Bazaltove|Janowa Dolina]]). Apart from already-existing industrial areas, in the mid-1930s, an ambitious, state-sponsored project of [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]] was started under Minister [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]]. One of characteristic features of Polish economy in the interbellum was gradual nationalization of major plants. This was the case of [[Ursus Factory]] (see [[Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne]]), and several steelworks, such as ''Huta Pokój'' in [[Ruda Śląska]] – Nowy Bytom, ''Huta Królewska'' in [[Chorzów]] – Królewska Huta, ''Huta Laura'' in [[Siemianowice Śląskie]], as well as ''Scheibler and Grohman Works'' in Łódź.&lt;ref name=&quot;liberte.pl&quot;/&gt;

[[File:WWII-Poland-1939-communications and industry.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Industry and communications in Poland before the start of World War II]]

According to the 1939 Statistical Yearbook of Poland, total length of railways of Poland (as for 31 December 1937) was {{convert|20,118|km|0|abbr=off}}. Rail density was {{convert|5.2|km|1|abbr=off}} per {{convert|100|km2|abbr=off}}. Railways were very dense in western part of the country, while in the east, especially [[Polesie]], rail was non-existent in some counties. During the interbellum period, the Polish government constructed several new lines, mainly in the central part of the country (see also [[Polish State Railroads Summer 1939]]). Construction of extensive [[Warszawa Główna railway station]] was never finished due to the war, and Polish railroads were famous for their punctuality (see [[Luxtorpeda]], [[Strzała Bałtyku]], [[Latający Wilnianin]]).

In the interbellum, road network of Poland was dense, but the quality of the roads was very poor – only 7% of all roads was paved and ready for automobile use, and none of the major cities were connected with each other by a good-quality highway. Poles built in 1939 only one highway, 28 km of straight concrete road connecting villages Warlubie and Osiek (mid-northern Poland). It was designed by Italian engineer Piero Puricelli.
[[File:CwsT1 torpedo.jpg|thumb|left|[[CWS T-1]] ''Torpedo'' was the first serially-built car manufactured in Poland]]

In the mid-1930s, Poland had {{convert|340,000|km|0|abbr=off}} of roads, but only 58,000 had hard surface (gravel, [[cobblestone]] or [[Sett (paving)|sett]]), and 2,500 were modern, with asphalt or concrete surface. In different parts of the country, there were sections of paved roads, which suddenly ended, and were followed by dirt roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;polityka&quot;/&gt; The poor condition of the roads was the result of both long-lasting foreign dominance and inadequate funding. On 29 January 1931, the Polish Parliament created the State Road Fund, the purpose of which was to collect money for the construction and conservation of roads. The government drafted a 10-year plan, with road priorities: a highway from Wilno, through Warsaw and Cracow, to Zakopane (called Marshall Pilsudski Highway), asphalt highways from Warsaw to Poznań and Łódź, as well as a Warsaw ring road. However, the plan turned out to be too ambitious, with insufficient money in the national budget to pay for it. In January 1938, the Polish Road Congress estimated that Poland would need to spend three times as much money on roads to keep up with Western Europe.

In 1939, before the outbreak of the war, [[LOT Polish Airlines]], which was established in 1929, had its hub at [[Warsaw Chopin Airport|Warsaw Okęcie Airport]]. At that time, LOT maintained several services, both domestic and international. Warsaw had regular domestic connections with [[Gdynia|Gdynia-Rumia]], [[Gdańsk|Danzig-Langfuhr]], [[Katowice-Muchowiec Airport|Katowice-Muchowiec]], [[Kraków-Rakowice-Czyżyny Airport|Kraków-Rakowice-Czyżyny,]] [[Lviv International Airport|Lwów-Skniłów]], [[Poznań-Ławica Airport|Poznań-Ławica]], and [[Vilnius|Wilno-Porubanek]]. Furthermore, in cooperation with [[Air France]], [[TAROM|LARES]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[Malert]], international connections were maintained with [[Athens]], [[Beirut]], Berlin, [[Bucharest]], [[Budapest]], Helsinki, [[Kaunas]], London, Paris, [[Prague]], [[Riga]], Rome, [[Tallinn]], and [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ministerstwa&quot;/&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[File:PL Ursus Ciągówka.jpg|thumb|upright|''Ciągówka Ursus'' was the first Polish farm tractor, produced in the years 1922-1927 in the [[Ursus Factory]]]]

Statistically, the majority of citizens lived in the countryside (75% in 1921). Farmers made up 65% of the population. In 1929, agricultural production made up 65% of Poland's GNP.&lt;ref name=&quot;lex&quot;/&gt; After 123 years of partitions, regions of the country were very unevenly developed. Lands of former German Empire were most advanced; in [[Greater Poland]] and [[Pomerelia]], crops were on Western European level.&lt;ref name=&quot;onet1&quot;/&gt; The situation was much worse in parts of [[Congress Poland]], [[Eastern Borderlands]], and former [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], where agriculture was most backward and primitive, with a large number of small farms, unable to succeed in either the domestic and international market. Another problem was the overpopulation of the countryside, which resulted in chronic unemployment. Living conditions were so bad that in several regions, such as counties inhabited by the [[Hutsuls]], there was permanent starvation.&lt;ref name=&quot;przeglad-tygodnik&quot;/&gt; Farmers rebelled against the government (see: [[1937 peasant strike in Poland]]), and the situation began to change in the late 1930s, due to construction of several factories for the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], which gave employment to thousands of countryside residents.

===German trade===
Beginning in June 1925 there was a customs' war with the [[revanchist]] Weimar Republic [[German–Polish customs war|imposing trade embargo against Poland]] for nearly a decade; involving tariffs, and broad economic restrictions. After 1933 the trade war ended. The new agreements regulated and promoted trade. Germany became Poland's largest trading partner, followed by Britain. In October 1938 Germany granted a credit of [[Reichsmark|Rm]] 60,000,000 to Poland (120,000,000 zloty, or £4,800,000) which was never realized, due to the outbreak of war. Germany would deliver factory equipment and machinery in return for Polish timber and agricultural produce. This new trade was to be ''in addition'' to the existing German-Polish trade agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;biznes&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140729024023/http://biznes.pwn.pl/haslo/3883929/celna-wojna.html Wojna celna (German–Polish customs' war)] (Internet Archive), Encyklopedia PWN, Biznes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives'' Volume 3, (October 1938) p. 3283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the Polish government [[Education in the Second Polish Republic|introduced compulsory education]] for all children aged 7 to 14, in an effort to limit illiteracy, which was widespread especially in the former [[Russian Partition]] and the [[Austrian Partition]] of eastern Poland. In 1921, one-third of citizens of Poland remained illiterate (38% in the countryside). The process was slow, but by 1931, the illiteracy level had dropped to 23% overall (27% in the countryside) and further down to 18% in 1937. By 1939, over 90% of children attended school.&lt;ref name=&quot;liberte.pl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies175&quot;&gt;[[Norman Davies]] (2005), ''God's Playground A History of Poland: Volume II: 1795 to the Present''. Oxford University Press, p. 175. {{ISBN|0199253390}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Minister of Religion and Education [[Janusz Jędrzejewicz]] carried out [[Jędrzejewicz reform|a major reform]] which introduced two main levels of education: ''common school'' (''szkoła powszechna''), with three levels – 4 grades + 2 grades + 1 grade; and ''middle school'' (''szkoła średnia''), with two levels – 4 grades of comprehensive middle school and 2 grades of specified high school (classical, humanistic, natural and mathematical). A graduate of middle school received a ''small [[matura]]'', while a graduate of high school received a ''big matura'', which enabled them to seek university-level education.

Before 1918, Poland had three universities: [[Jagiellonian University]], [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Lviv University|Lwów University]]. [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]] was established in 1918; [[Adam Mickiewicz University]], Poznań, in 1919; and finally, in 1922, after the annexation of [[Republic of Central Lithuania]], [[Vilnius University|Wilno University]] became the Republic's sixth university. There were also three [[technical college]]s: the [[Warsaw University of Technology]], [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lwów Polytechnic]] and the [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] in Kraków, established in 1919. [[Warsaw University of Life Sciences]] was an agricultural institute. By 1939, there were around 50,000 students enrolled in further education. Women made up 28% of university students, the second highest proportion in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;B. G. Smith. ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set''.

Polish science in the interbellum was renowned for its mathematicians gathered around the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]], the [[Kraków School of Mathematics]], as well as [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]]. There were world-class philosophers in the [[Lwów–Warsaw school]] of logic and philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;GaNeSt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=European Philosophy of Science - Philosophy of Science in Europe and the Viennese Heritage |authors=Maria Carla Galavotti, Elisabeth Nemeth, Friedrich Stadler |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2013 |ISBN=331901899X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UE_CBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Lvov-Warsaw+School |pages=408, 175–176, 180–183}} ''Also in:'' {{cite book |title=The Golden Age of Polish Philosophy: Kazimierz Twardowski's Philosophical Legacy |authors=Sandra Lapointe, Jan Wolenski, Mathieu Marion, Wioletta Miskiewicz |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2009 |ISBN=9048124018 |pages=127, 56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u84tl5ux0gC&amp;q=Tarski%27s+role+enormous}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florian Znaniecki]] founded Polish sociological studies. [[Rudolf Weigl]] invented a vaccine against typhus. [[Bronisław Malinowski]] counted among the most important anthropologists of the 20th century. In [[Polish literature]], the 1920s were marked by the domination of poetry. Polish poets were divided into two groups – the [[Skamander]]ites ([[Jan Lechoń]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Antoni Słonimski]] and [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]]) and the [[Futurism|Futurists]] ([[Anatol Stern]], [[Bruno Jasieński]], [[Aleksander Wat]], [[Julian Przyboś]]). Apart from well-established novelists ([[Stefan Żeromski]], [[Władysław Reymont]]), new names appeared in the interbellum – [[Zofia Nałkowska]], [[Maria Dąbrowska]], [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]], [[Jan Parandowski]], [[Bruno Schultz]], [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]]. Among other notable artists there were sculptor [[Xawery Dunikowski]], painters [[Julian Fałat]], [[Wojciech Kossak]] and [[Jacek Malczewski]], composers [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Feliks Nowowiejski]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], singer [[Jan Kiepura]]. Theatre was very popular in the interbellum, with three main centers in the cities of Warsaw, Wilno and Lwów. Altogether, there were 103 theaters in Poland and a number of other theatrical institutions (including 100 folk theaters). In 1936, different shows were seen by 5 million people, and main figures of Polish theatre of the time were [[Juliusz Osterwa]], [[Stefan Jaracz]], and [[Leon Schiller]]. Also, before the outbreak of the war, there were about a million radios (see [[Radio stations in interwar Poland]]).

== Administrative division ==
The [[Administrative division of the Second Polish Republic|administrative division of the Republic]] was based on a three-tier system. On the lowest rung were the ''[[Gmina|gminy]]'', local town and village governments akin to districts or parishes. These were then grouped together into ''[[powiat]]y'' (akin to counties), which, in turn, were grouped as ''województwa'' ([[voivodeship]]s, akin to provinces).

Historically, Poland was a nation of many nationalities. This was especially true after independence was regained in the wake of World War I and the subsequent [[Polish–Soviet War]] ending at [[Peace of Riga]]. The [[Polish census of 1921|census of 1921]] shows 30.8% of the population consisted of ethnic minorities,&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ&quot;/&gt; compared with 10% today.&lt;ref name=&quot;stat&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/Przynaleznosc_narodowo-etniczna_w_2011_NSP.pdf |title=Przynależność narodowo-etniczna ludności – wyniki spisu ludności i mieszkań 2011 |trans-title=Ethnic makeup of Polish citizenry according to census of 2011 |publisher=[[Central Statistical Office (Poland)|GUS]] |work=Materiał na konferencję prasową w dniu 2013-01-29 |pages=3, 4 |via=PDF file, direct download 192 KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first spontaneous flight of about 500,000 Poles from the Soviet Union occurred during the reconstitution of sovereign Poland. In the second wave, between November 1919 and June 1924 some 1,200,000 people left the territory of the USSR for Poland. It is estimated that some 460,000 of them spoke Polish as the first language.&lt;ref name=&quot;ePWN&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyklopedia PWN |chapter=Rosja.

The situation of minorities was a complex subject and changed during the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

Poland was also a nation of many religions. In 1921, 16,057,229 Poles (approx. 62.5%) were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman (Latin) Catholics]], 3,031,057 citizens of Poland (approx. 11.8%) were [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite Catholics]] (mostly [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholics]] and [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Rite Catholics]]), 2,815,817 (approx. 10.95%) were [[Russian Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], 2,771,949 (approx. 10.8%) were Jewish, and 940,232 (approx. 3.7%) were Protestants (mostly [[Lutheran]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;PSL&quot;/&gt;

By 1931, Poland had the second largest Jewish population in the world, with one-fifth of all the world's Jews residing within its borders (approx. 3,136,000).&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ&quot;/&gt; The urban population of interbellum Poland was rising steadily; in 1921, only 24% of Poles lived in the cities, in the late 1930s, that proportion grew to 30%. In more than a decade, the population of Warsaw grew by 200,000, Łódź by 150,000, and Poznań – by 100,000. This was due not only to internal migration, but also to an extremely high birth rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;liberte.pl&quot;/&gt;

== Geography ==
The Second Polish Republic was mainly flat with average elevation of {{convert|233|m|ft|abbr=out}} [[above sea level]], except for the southernmost [[Carpathian Mountains]] (after World War II and its border changes, the average elevation of Poland decreased to {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=out}}). Only 13% of territory, along the southern border, was higher than {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=out}}. The highest elevation in the country was [[Mount Rysy]], which rises {{convert|2,499|m|ft|abbr=out}} in the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra Range]] of the Carpathians, approximately {{convert|95|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Kraków]]. Between October 1938 and September 1939, the highest elevation was Lodowy Szczyt (known in the [[Slovak language]] as ''Ľadový štít''), which rises {{convert|2,627|m|ft|abbr=out}} above sea level. The largest lake was [[Lake Narach]].
[[File:Poland1939 physical.jpg|thumb|300px|Physical map of the Second Polish Republic]]

The country's total area, after the annexation of Zaolzie, was {{convert|389,720|km2}}. It extended {{convert|903|km|abbr=off}} from north to south and {{convert|894|km|abbr=off}} from east to west. On 1 January 1938, total length of boundaries was {{convert|5529|km|abbr=off}}, including: {{convert|140|km|abbr=off}} of coastline (out of which {{convert|71|km|abbr=off}} were made by the [[Hel Peninsula]]), the {{convert|1,412|km|abbr=off}} with Soviet Union, 948 kilometers with Czechoslovakia (until 1938), {{convert|1,912|km|abbr=off}} with Germany (together with [[East Prussia]]), and {{convert|10,81|km|abbr=off}} with other countries (Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, Danzig). The warmest yearly average temperature was in Kraków among major cities of the Second Polish Republic, at {{convert|9.1|C|F|1}} in 1938; and the coldest in Wilno ({{convert|7.6|C|F|1|disp=or}} in 1938). Extreme geographical points of Poland included Przeświata River in Somino to the north (located in the [[Braslaw]] county of the [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926–39)|Wilno Voivodeship]]); Manczin River to the south (located in the [[Kosiv|Kosów]] county of the [[Stanisławów Voivodeship]]); Spasibiorki near railway to Połock to the east (located in the [[Dzisna]] county of the [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926–39)|Wilno Voivodeship]]); and Mukocinek near Warta River and Meszyn Lake to the west (located in the [[Międzychód]] county of the [[Poznań Voivodeship]]).

===Waters===
Almost 75% of the territory of interbellum Poland was drained northward into the Baltic Sea by the [[Vistula]] (total area of [[drainage basin]] of the Vistula within boundaries of the Second Polish Republic was {{convert|180,300|km2|abbr=off}}, the [[Niemen]] ({{convert|51,600|km2|disp=or|abbr=off}}), the [[Oder|Odra]] ({{convert|46,700|km2|disp=or|abbr=off}}) and the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] ({{convert|10,400|km2|disp=or|abbr=off}}). The remaining part of the country was drained southward, into the [[Black Sea]], by the rivers that drain into the [[Dnieper]] ([[Pripyat River|Pripyat]], [[Horyn]] and [[Styr]], all together {{convert|61,500|km2|disp=or|abbr=off}}) as well as [[Dniester]] ({{convert|41,400|km2|disp=or|abbr=off}})

==German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939==

{{see also|Polish armaments 1939–45|Polish army order of battle in 1939}}

The Second World War in 1939 put an end to the sovereign Second Polish Republic. The German [[invasion of Poland]] began on 1 September 1939, one week after [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] signed the secret [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. On that day, Germany and [[Slovak invasion of Poland (1939)|Slovakia]] attacked Poland, and on 17 September the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] [[Soviet invasion of Poland|attacked]] [[Kresy|eastern Poland]]. [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw fell to the Nazis]] on 28 September after a twenty-day siege. Open organized Polish resistance ended on 6 October 1939 after the [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]], with Germany and the Soviet Union occupying most of the country. [[State of Lithuania|Lithuania]] annexed [[Vilnius Region|the area of Wilno]], and [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovakia]] seized areas along Poland's southern border - including [[Górna Orawa]] and [[Tatranská Javorina]] - which Poland had annexed from Czechoslovakia in October 1938. Poland did not surrender to the invaders, but continued fighting under the auspices of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and of the [[Polish Underground State]]. After the signing of the [[German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation]] on 28 September 1939, Polish areas occupied by Nazi Germany either became directly annexed to the [[Third Reich]], or became part of the so-called [[General Government]]. The Soviet Union, following rigged [[Elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus]] (22 October 1939), annexed eastern Poland partly to the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and partly to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (November 1939).
[[File:7TP-2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish [[7TP|light tanks 7TP]]]]

Polish war plans ([[Plan West]] and [[Plan East]]) failed as soon as Germany invaded in 1939. The Polish losses in combat against Germans (killed and missing in action) amounted to ca. 70,000 men. Some 420,000 of them were taken prisoners. Losses against the Red Army (which invaded Poland on 17 September) added up to 6,000 to 7,000 of casualties and MIA, 250,000 were taken prisoners. Although the Polish army – considering the inactivity of the Allies – was in an unfavorable position – it managed to inflict serious losses to the enemies: 14,000 German soldiers were killed or MIA, 674 tanks and 319 armored vehicles destroyed or badly damaged, 230 aircraft shot down; the Red Army lost (killed and MIA) about 2,500 soldiers, 150 combat vehicles and 20 aircraft. The Soviet invasion of Poland, and lack of promised aid from the Western Allies, contributed to the Polish forces defeat by 6 October 1939.
[[File:ORP Orzeł w Gdyni.jpg|thumb|right|[[ORP Orzeł (1938)|ORP Orzeł]] was the [[lead ship]] of [[Orzeł-class submarine|her class]] of [[submarine]]s serving in the [[Polish Navy]] during [[World War II]]]]

A popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This often repeated account, first reported by Italian journalists as [[Polish cavalry#Cavalry charges and propaganda|German propaganda]], concerned an action by the Polish 18th Lancer Regiment near Chojnice. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September 1939 near [[Charge at Krojanty|Krojanty]], when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabers surprised and wiped out a German infantry formation with a mounted sabre charge. Shortly after midnight the 2nd (Motorized) Division was compelled to withdraw by Polish cavalry, before the Poles were caught in the open by German armored cars. The story arose because some German armored cars appeared and gunned down 20 troopers as the cavalry escaped. Even this failed to persuade everyone to reexamine their beliefs—there were some who thought Polish cavalry had been improperly employed in 1939.

Between 1939 and 1990, the Polish government-in-exile operated in Paris and later in London, presenting itself as the only legal and legitimate representative of the [[Polish nation]]. In 1990 the last president in exile, [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] handed the presidential insignia to the newly elected [[President of Poland|President]], [[Lech Wałęsa]], signifying continuity between the Second and [[Third Polish Republic|Third]] republics.

[[Image:Van de Velde, Resolution in a Gale.jpg|thumb|200px|''Resolution in a gale'' by [[Willem van de Velde, the younger]] depicts the second ''Resolution'' c. 1678]]
Several ships of the [[Royal Navy]] have borne the name '''HMS ''Resolution'''''. However, the first English warship to bear the name ''Resolution'' was actually the [[first rate]] [[English ship Prince Royal (1610)|''Prince Royal'']] (built in 1610 and rebuilt in 1641), which was renamed ''Resolution'' in 1650 following the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and continued to bear that name until 1660, when the name ''Prince Royal'' was restored. The name ''Resolution'' was bestowed on the first of the vessels listed below:

* [[English ship Resolution (1654)|''Resolution'' (1654)]], a 50-gun [[third-rate]] [[frigate#Origins|frigate]] launched 1654 as ''Tredagh''; renamed ''Resolution'' 1660; destroyed after grounding by a Dutch [[fireship]] in the [[St James's Day Battle]] 4 August 1666.
* {{HMS|Resolution|1667}}, a 70-gun third-rate [[ship of the line]] launched 1667; rebuilt 1698; foundered in 1703.
* {{HMS|Resolution|1705}}, a 70-gun third rate launched 1705; run ashore to avoid capture 1707.
* {{HMS|Resolution|1708}}, a 70-gun third rate launched 1708; wrecked 1711.
* {{HMS|Resolution|1758}}, a 74-gun third rate launched 1758; run aground and lost 1759 at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]].
* {{HMS|Resolution|1770}}, a 74-gun third rate launched 1770; broken up 1813.
* {{HMS|Resolution|1771}}, the vessel of Captain [[James Cook]] in his explorations.
* {{HMS|Resolution|1779}}, a [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] purchased 1779; went missing in the North Sea June 1797, presumed to have foundered.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{HMS|Resolution|1892}}, a {{sclass-|Royal Sovereign|battleship}} in service from 1893 to 1914.
* {{HMS|Resolution|09}}, a {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|2}} in service from 1915 to 1944.
* {{HMS|Resolution|S22}}, [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Resolution|submarine|0}} [[ballistic missile]] [[submarine]]s in service from 1966 to 1994.

;Also
*''Resolution'' was a gunboat that the garrison at Gibraltar launched in June 1782 during the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]]. She was one of 12. Each was armed with an 18-pounder gun, and received a crew of 21 men drawn from Royal Navy vessels stationed at Gibraltar. {{HMS|Brilliant|1779|2}} provided ''Resolution''{{'}}s crew.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater (1905), p.246.&lt;/ref&gt;
* HMS ''Resolution'', a cutter in the West Indies, date of acquisition unknown and date of loss unknown. On 10 November 1800 Captain [[Sir Peter Halkett, 6th Baronet|Peter Halkett]] of {{HMS|Apollo|1799|6}} captured the Spanish sloop of war ''Resolution'' in the West Indies. She was armed with 18 guns and had a crew of 149 men, under the command of Don Francisco Darrichena. Halkett reported that she was the former British navy cutter ''Resolution''. ''Resolution'' was in such an irreparable state that after a few days Halkett destroyed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|pages=149–150|issue=15334|date=3 February 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Resolution'', a victualing [[Hoy (ship)|hoy]], of 75 tons, offered for sale on 22 September 1828, lying at Deptford.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=9 September 1828|issue=18503|page=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Adams Keller''' (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist, and lecturer. She was the first [[deaf-blindness|deaf-blind]] person to earn a bachelor of arts degree. The story of how Keller's teacher, [[Anne Sullivan]], broke through the isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to communicate, has become widely known through the dramatic depictions of the play and film ''[[The Miracle Worker]]''. Her birthplace in West [[Tuscumbia, Alabama]], is now a museum&lt;ref name=birthplace&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.helenkellerbirthplace.org| title=Helen Keller Birthplace | publisher=Helen Keller Birthplace Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsors an annual &quot;Helen Keller Day&quot;. Her birthday on June 27 is commemorated as Helen Keller Day in the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]] and was authorized at the federal level by presidential proclamation by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1980, the 100th anniversary of her birth.

A prolific author, Keller was well-traveled and outspoken in her convictions. A member of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], she campaigned for [[women's suffrage]], [[labor rights]], [[socialism]], [[antimilitarism]], and other similar causes. She was inducted into the [[Alabama Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.awhf.org/inductee.html| title=Inductees|work=Alabama Women's Hall of Fame| publisher=State of Alabama| accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of twelve inaugural inductees to the Alabama Writers Hall of Fame on June 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|  title=Harper Lee Among Inaugural Inductees Into Alabama Writers Hall of Fame| work=[[The Huffington Post]]| date=June 8, 2015| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/08/harper-lee-alabama-writers-hall-fame_n_7533756.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keller proved to the world that deaf people could all learn to communicate and that they could survive in the hearing world. She also taught that deaf people are capable of doing things that hearing people can do. One of the most famous deaf people in history, she is an idol to many deaf people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perkins.org/history/people/anne-sullivan|title=Anne Sullivan|last=McGinnity|first=B.L|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her paternal lineage was traced to Casper Keller, a native of [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=StoryofmyLife/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ask1105&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.afb.org/braillebug/askkeller.asp?issueid=200511|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind| title=Ask Keller| date=November 2005| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Helen's Swiss ancestors was the first teacher for the deaf in Zurich. Keller reflected on this coincidence in her first autobiography, stating &quot;that there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among his.&quot;&lt;ref name=StoryofmyLife/&gt;

Helen Keller was born with the ability to see and hear. At 19 months old, she contracted an unknown illness described by doctors as &quot;an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain&quot;,&lt;ref name=askKellerIllness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://braillebug.afb.org/askkeller.asp?issueid=20052|title=Ask Keller|date=February 2005|accessdate=June 13, 2017|publisher=[[American Foundation for the Blind]]|quote=Helen's illness was diagnosed by her doctor as &quot;acute congestion of the stomach and the brain&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might have been [[scarlet fever]] or [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name=perkinsFAQ&gt;{{cite web| title=Helen Keller FAQ| publisher=[[Perkins School for the Blind]]| url=http://www.perkins.org/vision-loss/helen-keller| accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.afb.org/info/about-us/helen-keller/biography-and-chronology/biography/1235| title=Helen Keller Biography| website=American Foundation for the Blind| access-date=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illness left her both deaf and blind. At that time, she was able to communicate somewhat with Martha Washington, the six-year-old daughter of the family cook, who understood her signs;&lt;ref name=mylife&gt;{{cite web| location=New York| publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Company| url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/life.html| title=The Story of My Life| first=Helen| last=Keller| year=1905| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} by the age of seven, Keller had more than 60 [[home sign]]s to communicate with her family. Even though blind and deaf, Helen Keller had passed through many obstacles and she learned to live with her disabilities. She learned how to tell which person was walking by from the vibrations their footsteps would make. The sex and age of the person could be identified by how strong and continuous the steps were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sDrSMbHwkiIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=helen+keller&amp;ots=1hLj9m2_GL&amp;sig=U_LnkYRJBpUuSLL7xjtykZmj_No#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20keller&amp;f=false|title=The World I Live In|last=Shattuck|first=Roger|date=1904|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Keller's mother, inspired by an account in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[American Notes]]'' of the successful education of another deaf and blind woman, [[Laura Bridgman]], dispatched the young Keller, accompanied by her father, to seek out physician J. Julian Chisolm, an eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist in [[Baltimore]], for advice.&lt;ref name=Worthington&gt;{{cite book| last=Worthington| first=W. Curtis| title=A Family Album: Men Who Made the Medical Center| date=March 1990| url=http://www.muschealth.com/about_us/history/chislom.htm| publisher=Reprint Co| isbn=978-0-87152-444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm referred the Kellers to [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who was working with deaf children at the time. Bell advised them to contact the [[Perkins Institute for the Blind]], the school where Bridgman had been educated, which was then located in [[South Boston, Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]]. Michael Anagnos, the school's director, asked 20-year-old former student [[Anne Sullivan Macy|Anne Sullivan]], herself visually impaired, to become Keller's instructor. It was the beginning of a 49-year-long relationship during which Sullivan evolved into Keller's [[governess]] and eventually her [[lady's companion|companion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mylife&quot;/&gt;{{rp|Introduction, Key Figures}}

Sullivan arrived at Keller's house in March 1887, and immediately began to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words into her hand, beginning with &quot;d-o-l-l&quot; for the doll that she had brought Keller as a present. Keller was frustrated, at first, because she did not understand that every object had a word uniquely identifying it. In fact, when Sullivan was trying to teach Keller the word for &quot;mug&quot;, Keller became so frustrated she broke the mug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkie&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilkie| first=Katherine E.| title=Helen Keller: Handicapped Girl| publisher=Atheneum| date=January 1969| isbn=978-0-672-50076-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keller's breakthrough in communication came the next month, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of &quot;water&quot;; she then nearly exhausted Sullivan demanding the names of all the other familiar objects in her world.

Helen Keller was viewed as isolated, but was very in touch with the outside world. She was able to enjoy music by feeling the beat and she was able to have a strong connection with animals through touch. She was delayed at picking up language, but that did not stop her from having a voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apa.sagepub.com/content/13/3/533.extract|title=Observation on a Natural Experiment|last=Dahl|first=Hartvig|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal education==
In May 1888, Keller started attending the Perkins Institute for the Blind. In 1894, Keller and Sullivan moved to New York to attend the [[Wright-Humason School for the Deaf]], and to learn from [[Sarah Fuller]] at the [[Horace Mann School for the Deaf]]. In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts, and Keller entered [[The Cambridge School of Weston|The Cambridge School for Young Ladies]] before gaining admittance, in 1900, to [[Radcliffe College]],&lt;ref name=radcliff&gt;{{cite journal |title=HELEN KELLER IN COLLEGE – Blind, Dumb and Deaf Girl Now Studying at Radcliffe |journal=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=October 13, 1900 |page=16 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1900/10/13/page/16/article/helen-keller-in-college}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she lived in Briggs Hall, [[Cabot House|South House]]. Her admirer, [[Mark Twain]], had introduced her to [[Standard Oil]] magnate [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]], who, with his wife Abbie, paid for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated from Radcliffe, becoming the first deaf blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She maintained a correspondence with the Austrian philosopher and [[pedagogue]] [[Wilhelm Jerusalem]], who was one of the first to discover her literary talent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Gantschacher]] &quot;Back from History! – The correspondence of letters between the Austrian-Jewish philosopher Wilhelm Jerusalem and the American [[deafblind]] writer Helen Keller&quot;, Gebärdensache, Vienna 2009, p. 35ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined to communicate with others as conventionally as possible, Keller learned to speak, and spent much of her life giving speeches and lectures on aspects of her life. She learned to &quot;hear&quot; people's speech by reading their lips with her hands—her sense of touch had heightened. She became proficient at using [[braille]]&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, the reordered alphabet known as [[American Braille]]&lt;/ref&gt; and reading [[sign language]] with her hands as well. Shortly before World War I, with the assistance of the [[Zoellner Quartet]], she determined that by placing her fingertips on a resonant tabletop she could experience music played close by.&lt;ref name=Spectrum2&gt;[http://library.ndsu.edu/tools/dspace/load/?file=/repository/bitstream/handle/10365/21055/nds-1917-10-31-0.pdf?sequence=1 &quot;First Number Citizens Lecture Course Monday, November Fifth&quot;, ''The Weekly Spectrum''], North Dakota Agricultural College, Volume XXXVI no. 3, November 7, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of her lectures==
On January 22, 1916, Keller and Sullivan traveled to the small town of [[Menomonie, Wisconsin|Menomonie]] in western Wisconsin to deliver a lecture at the [[Mabel Tainter Memorial Building]]. Details of her talk were provided in the weekly ''Dunn County News'' on January 22, 1916:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A message of optimism, of hope, of good cheer, and of loving service was brought to Menomonie Saturday—a message that will linger long with those fortunate enough to have received it. This message came with the visit of Helen Keller and her teacher, Mrs. John Macy, and both had a hand in imparting it Saturday evening to a splendid audience that filled The Memorial. The wonderful girl who has so brilliantly triumphed over the triple afflictions of blindness, dumbness and deafness, gave a talk with her own lips on &quot;Happiness,&quot; and it will be remembered always as a piece of inspired teaching by those who heard it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When part of the account was reprinted in the January 20, 2016, edition of the paper under the heading &quot;From the Files&quot;, the column compiler added

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to those who attended, Helen Keller spoke of the joy that life gave her. She was thankful for the faculties and abilities that she did possess and stated that the most productive pleasures she had were curiosity and imagination. Keller also spoke of the joy of service and the happiness that came from doing things for others&amp;nbsp;... Keller imparted that &quot;helping your fellow men were one's only excuse for being in this world and in the doing of things to help one's fellows lay the secret of lasting happiness.&quot; She also told of the joys of loving work and accomplishment and the happiness of achievement. Although the entire lecture lasted only a little over an hour, the lecture had a profound impact on the audience.&lt;ref name=Koser&gt;{{cite news| first=Jessica| last=Koser| title=From the files: New library is now open to the public| work=Dunn County News| date=January 19, 2016| url=http://chippewa.com/dunnconnect/news/local/history/from-the-files-new-library-is-now-open-to-the/article_c0bd9d80-6056-5e47-b7f5-77887e7a4a0e.html| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companions==

[[Anne Sullivan]] stayed as a companion to Helen Keller long after she taught her. Sullivan married John Macy in 1905, and her health started failing around 1914. Polly Thomson (February 20, 1885&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrmann1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrmann|first=Dorothy|title=Helen Keller: A Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VUp4uh87_eUC&amp;pg=PA266|accessdate=12 November 2017|date=1999-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226327631|pages=266–}}&lt;/ref&gt; – March 21, 1960) was hired to keep house. She was a young woman from Scotland who had no experience with deaf or blind people. She progressed to working as a secretary as well, and eventually became a constant companion to Keller.&lt;ref name=grace&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.graceproducts.com/helenkeller.htm| title=Tragedy to Triumph: An Adventure with Helen Keller| publisher=Graceproducts.com| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keller moved to [[Forest Hills, Queens]], together with Sullivan and Macy, and used the house as a base for her efforts on behalf of the [[American Foundation for the Blind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rnib&quot;/&gt;  &quot;While in her thirties Helen had a love affair, became secretly engaged, and defied her teacher and family by attempting an elopement with the man she loved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Helen Keller's Secret Love Life| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rosie-sultan/helen-keller_b_1477393.html| last=Sultan| first=Rosie| date=May 14, 2012| work=The Huffington Post| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was &quot;Peter Fagan, a young [[Boston Herald]] reporter who was sent to Helen's home to act as her private secretary when lifelong companion, Anne, fell ill.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Helen Keller's forbidden love: New book inspired by the author's clandestine engagement tells of thwarted romance and broken hearts| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2141491/Helen-Kellers-forbidden-love-New-book-inspired-authors-clandestine-engagement-tells-thwarted-romance-broken-hearts.html| last=Wellman| first=Victoria| work=[[Daily Mail]]| date=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They traveled worldwide and raised funds for the blind. Thomson had a stroke in 1957 from which she never fully recovered, and died in 1960.

Keller went on to become a world-famous speaker and author. She is remembered as an [[List of disability rights activists|advocate for people with disabilities]], amid numerous other causes. The Deaf community was widely impacted by her. She traveled to twenty-five different countries giving motivational speeches about Deaf people's conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perkins.org/history/people/helen-keller|title=Helen Keller|last=McGinnity|first=B.L|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was a [[suffragette]], [[pacifist]], [[radical politics|radical]] socialist, [[birth control]] supporter, and opponent of [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In 1915 she and George A. Kessler founded the [[Helen Keller International]] (HKI) organization. This organization is devoted to research in vision, health and nutrition. In 1920, she helped to found the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). Keller traveled to over 40 countries with Sullivan, making several trips to Japan and becoming a favorite of the [[Japanese people]]. Keller met every U.S. President from [[Grover Cleveland]] to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and was friends with many famous figures, including [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Mark Twain]]. Keller and Twain were both considered radicals at the beginning of the 20th century, and as a consequence, their political views have been forgotten or glossed over in the popular mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewen&quot;/&gt;

Keller was a member of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and actively campaigned and wrote in support of the working class from 1909 to 1921. Many of her speeches and writings were about women's right to vote and the impacts of war. She had speech therapy in order to have her voice heard better by the public. When the Rockefeller-owned press refused to print her articles, she protested until her work was finally published.&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8EOmueJ2j0cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP15&amp;dq=helen+keller+story&amp;ots=bzjLWUswMr&amp;sig=-F42sLGAU_xVYyaegDDubac8ijo#v=onepage&amp;q=helen%20keller%20story&amp;f=false|title=The Radical Lives of Helen Keller|last=Nielsen|first=Kim|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supported Socialist Party candidate [[Eugene V. Debs]] in each of his campaigns for the presidency. Before reading [[Progress and poverty|''Progress and Poverty'']], Helen Keller was already a socialist who believed that [[Georgism]] was a good step in the right direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Wonder Woman at Massey Hall|url=http://www.billgladstone.ca/?p=6485| accessdate=October 31, 2014| work=[[Toronto Star|Toronto Star Weekly]]| date=January 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She later wrote of finding &quot;in [[Henry George]]'s philosophy a rare beauty and power of inspiration, and a splendid faith in the essential nobility of human nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKFQdRePRBYC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;ots=6waJoLbN-2&amp;dq=Helen%20Keller%20henry%20george&amp;pg=PA262#v=onepage&amp;q=Helen%20Keller%20henry%20george&amp;f=false| title=Progress &amp; Poverty| last=George| first=Henry| publisher=Robert Schalkenbach Foundation| year=1998| isbn=978-0-911312-10-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keller claimed that newspaper columnists who had praised her courage and intelligence before she expressed her socialist views now called attention to her disabilities. The editor of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'' wrote that her &quot;mistakes sprung out of the manifest limitations of her development.&quot; Keller responded to that editor, referring to having met him before he knew of her political views: {{quote|At that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that I blush to remember them. But now that I have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that I am blind and deaf and especially liable to error. I must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since I met him.&amp;nbsp;... Oh, ridiculous ''Brooklyn Eagle''!

For the first time I, who had thought blindness a misfortune beyond human control, found that too much of it was traceable to wrong industrial conditions, often caused by the selfishness and greed of employers. And the social evil contributed its share. I found that poverty drove women to a life of shame that ended in blindness.}}

The last sentence refers to prostitution and [[syphilis]], the former a frequent cause of the latter, and the latter a leading cause of blindness. In the same interview, Keller also cited the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 strike of textile workers]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] for instigating her support of socialism.

Keller supported [[eugenics]]. In 1915 she wrote in favor of refusing life-saving medical procedures to infants with severe mental impairments or physical deformities, stating that their lives were not worthwhile and they would likely become criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=Kim E.|title=The Radical Lives of Helen Keller|date=1 April 2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, NY|isbn=0814758142|pages=36–37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVQTCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pernick|first1=M S|title=Eugenics and public health in American history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 1997|volume=87|issue=11|pages=1767–1772|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.87.11.1767|accessdate=12 October 2016|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.11.1767|pmid=9366633|pmc=1381159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keller also expressed concerns about [[human overpopulation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmquotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=https://www.populationmatters.org/making-case/quotations/|publisher=[[Population Matters]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wpbquotes&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/quotes|publisher=World Population Balance|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Helen Keller13.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Keller, circa 1912]]
Keller wrote a total of 12 published books and several articles.

One of her earliest pieces of writing, at age 11, was ''[[The Frost King]]'' (1891). There were allegations that this story had been [[plagiarized]] from ''The Frost Fairies'' by Margaret Canby. An investigation into the matter revealed that Keller may have experienced a case of [[cryptomnesia]], which was that she had Canby's story read to her but forgot about it, while the memory remained in her subconscious.&lt;ref name=&quot;rnib&quot;/&gt;

At age 22, Keller published her autobiography, ''[[The Story of My Life (biography)|The Story of My Life]]'' (1903), with help from Sullivan and Sullivan's husband, John Macy. It recounts the story of her life up to age 21 and was written during her time in college.

Keller wrote ''The World I Live In'' in 1908, giving readers an insight into how she felt about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Keller| first=Helen| title=The World I Live In| url=https://archive.org/details/worldilivein00kelluoft| year=1910| publisher=The Century Co| location=New York| isbn=978-1-59017-067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Out of the Dark'', a series of essays on socialism, was published in 1913.

When Keller was young, Anne Sullivan introduced her to [[Phillips Brooks]], who introduced her to Christianity, Keller famously saying: &quot;I always knew He was there, but I didn't know His name!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge of God 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&amp;pg=PA591&amp;dq=Helen+Keller+didn't+know+His+name#v=onepage&amp;q=Helen%20Keller%20didn't%20know%20His%20name&amp;f=false| title=Willmington's Guide to the Bible| first=H.

Her [[Spirituality|spiritual]] autobiography, ''My Religion'',&lt;ref name=MyReligion&gt;{{cite book| date=March 17, 2007| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7oPaKrr4x4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=my+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EElYTYHQBoG8lQfc0rndBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=divine%20providence&amp;f=false| title=My Religion| last=Keller| first=Helen| publisher=The Book Tree| isbn=978-1-58509-284-0| pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1927 and then in 1994 extensively revised and re-issued under the title ''[[Light in My Darkness]]''. It advocates the teachings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], the Christian revelator and theologian who gives a spiritual interpretation of the teachings of the Bible and who claims that the [[second coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] has already taken place. Adherents use several names to describe themselves, including Second Advent Christian, [[Swedenborgian]], and New Church.

Keller described the progressive views of her belief in these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But in Swedenborg's teaching it [Divine Providence] is shown to be the government of God's Love and Wisdom and the creation of uses. Since His Life cannot be less in one being than another, or His Love manifested less fully in one thing than another, His Providence must needs be universal&amp;nbsp;... He has provided religion of some kind everywhere, and it does not matter to what race or creed anyone belongs if he is faithful to his ideals of right living.&lt;ref name=MyReligion/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later life==
Keller suffered a series of strokes in 1961 and spent the last years of her life at her home.&lt;ref name=&quot;rnib&quot;/&gt;

On September 14, 1964, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] awarded her the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], one of the United States' two highest civilian honors. In 1965 she was elected to the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rnib&quot;/&gt;

Keller devoted much of her later life to raising funds for the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]. She died in her sleep on June 1, 1968, at her home, Arcan Ridge, located in [[Easton, Connecticut]], a few weeks short of her eighty-eighth birthday. A service was held in her honor at the [[Washington National Cathedral|National Cathedral]] in Washington, D.C., her body was cremated and her ashes were placed there next to her constant companions, Anne Sullivan and Polly Thomson. She was buried at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Keller's life has been interpreted many times. She appeared in a [[silent film]], ''[[Deliverance (1919 movie)|Deliverance]]'' (1919), which told her story in a melodramatic, allegorical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010061/| accessdate=June 15, 2006| title=Deliverance (1919)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also the subject of the documentaries ''[[Helen Keller in Her Story]]'', narrated by [[Katharine Cornell]], and ''The Story of Helen Keller'', part of the Famous Americans series produced by [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Entertainment]].

''[[The Miracle Worker]]'' is a [[Literature cycle|cycle]] of dramatic works ultimately derived from her autobiography, ''[[The Story of My Life (biography)|The Story of My Life]]''. The various dramas each describe the relationship between Keller and Sullivan, depicting how the teacher led her from a state of almost [[feral children|feral wildness]] into education, activism, and intellectual celebrity. The common title of the cycle echoes [[Mark Twain]]'s description of Sullivan as a &quot;miracle worker.&quot; Its first realization was the 1957 ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' [[screenplay|teleplay]] of that title by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]]. He adapted it for a [[The Miracle Worker (play)|Broadway production in 1959]] and an Oscar-winning [[The Miracle Worker (1962 film)|feature film in 1962]], starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Patty Duke]]. It was remade for television in 1979 and 2000.

In 1984, Keller's life story was made into a TV movie called ''[[The Miracle Continues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087401/| accessdate=June 15, 2006| title=Helen Keller: The Miracle Continues (1984) (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film that entailed the semi-sequel to ''The Miracle Worker'' recounts her college years and her early adult life. None of the early movies hint at the [[social activism]] that would become the hallmark of Keller's later life, although a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] version produced in 2000 states in the credits that she became an activist for [[social equality]].

The [[Bollywood]] movie ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005) was largely based on Keller's story, from her childhood to her graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Güler| first1=Emrah| title=Helen Keller story inspires Turkish film| url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/helen-keller-story-inspires-turkish-film.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=56916&amp;NewsCatID=381| accessdate=April 26, 2015| work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]| date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary called ''Shining Soul: Helen Keller's Spiritual Life and Legacy'' was produced by the Swedenborg Foundation in the same year. The film focuses on the role played by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s spiritual theology in her life and how it inspired Keller's triumph over her triple disabilities of blindness, deafness and a severe speech impediment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

A stamp was issued in 1980 by the [[United States Postal Service]] depicting Keller and Sullivan, to mark the centennial of Keller's birth.

On October 7, 2009, a bronze statue of Helen Keller was added to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], as a replacement for the State of Alabama's former 1908 statue of the education reformer [[Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry]]. It is displayed in the [[United States Capitol Visitor Center]] and depicts Keller as a seven-year-old child standing at a [[Hand pump|water pump]]. The statue represents the seminal moment in Keller's life when she understood her first word: W-A-T-E-R, as signed into her hand by teacher Anne Sullivan.

[[File:Knight2.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration by [[John Tenniel]] ]]
'''Haddocks' Eyes''' is a term for the name of a poem by [[Lewis Carroll]] from ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. It is sung by [[The White Knight (Through the Looking Glass)|The White Knight]] in [[s:Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There/Chapter VIII|chapter eight]] to a tune that he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as &quot;[[My Heart and Lute|I give thee all, I can no more]]&quot;.

By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.

It parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of &quot;[[Resolution and Independence]]&quot; by [[William Wordsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lewis |last=Carroll |editor-first=Martin |editor-last=Gardner |title=[[The Annotated Alice]]: The Definitive Edition |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-04847-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poem origins: Through the Looking Glass |url=http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/analysis/poem-origins/through-the-looking-glass/|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==

The White Knight explains a confusing nomenclature for the song.

*The song's '''name''' is '''called''' ''Haddocks' Eyes''
*The song's '''name''' is ''The Aged Aged Man''
*The song is '''called''' ''Ways and Means''
*The song '''is''' ''A-sitting on a Gate''

The complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' both uses and mentions the [[use–mention distinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Norman |last=Swartz |title=Use and Mention |url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/use_and_mention.htm |publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]] |date=27 September 1997 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Poem==

:I'll tell thee everything I can:
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There's little to relate.
:I saw an aged aged man,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A-sitting on a gate.
:&quot;Who are you, aged man?&quot; I said,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;And how is it you live?&quot;
:And his answer trickled through my head,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Like water through a sieve.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:He said &quot;I look for butterflies
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That sleep among the wheat:
:I make them into mutton-pies,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And sell them in the street.
:I sell them unto men,&quot; he said,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Who sail on stormy seas;
:And that's the way I get my bread –
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A trifle, if you please.&quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:But I was thinking of a plan
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To dye one's whiskers green,
:And always use so large a fan
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That they could not be seen.
:So, having no reply to give
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To what the old man said,
:I cried &quot;Come, tell me how you live!&quot;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And thumped him on the head.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:His accents mild took up the tale:
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He said &quot;I go my ways,
:And when I find a mountain-rill,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I set it in a blaze;
:And thence they make a stuff they call
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Rowlands' [[Macassar-Oil]] –
:Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They give me for my toil.&quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:But I was thinking of a way
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To feed oneself on batter,
:And so go on from day to day
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Getting a little fatter.
:I shook him well from side to side,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Until his face was blue:
:&quot;Come, tell me how you live,&quot; I cried,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;And what it is you do!&quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:He said &quot;I hunt for haddocks' eyes
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Among the heather bright,
:And work them into waistcoat-buttons
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the silent night.
:And these I do not sell for gold
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or coin of silvery shine,
:But for a copper halfpenny,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And that will purchase nine.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:&quot;I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or set limed twigs for crabs:
:I sometimes search the grassy knolls
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For wheels of [[Hansom cab|Hansom-cabs]].
:And that's the way&quot; (he gave a wink)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&quot;By which I get my wealth--
:And very gladly will I drink
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Your Honour's noble health.&quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:I heard him then, for I had just
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Completed my design
:To keep the [[Menai Suspension Bridge|Menai bridge]] from rust
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By boiling it in wine.
:I thanked him much for telling me
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The way he got his wealth,
:But chiefly for his wish that he
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Might drink my noble health.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:And now, if e'er by chance I put
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My fingers into glue,
:Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Into a left-hand shoe,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:Or if I drop upon my toe
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A very heavy weight,
:I weep, for it reminds me so
:Of that old man I used to know--
:Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow
:Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
:Whose face was very like a crow,
:With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
:Who seemed distracted with his woe,
:Who rocked his body to and fro,
:And muttered mumblingly and low,
:As if his mouth were full of dough,
:Who snorted like a buffalo--
:That summer evening long ago,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A-sitting on a gate.

==Upon the Lonely Moor==

Like &quot;[[Jabberwocky]],&quot; another poem published in ''Through the Looking Glass,'' &quot;Haddocks’ Eyes&quot; appears to have been revised over the course of many years. In 1856, Carroll published the following poem anonymously under the name ''Upon the Lonely Moor''. It bears an obvious resemblance to &quot;Haddocks' Eyes.&quot;

:I met an aged, aged man
:Upon the lonely moor:
:I knew I was a gentleman,
:And he was but a boor.
:So I stopped and roughly questioned him,
:&quot;Come, tell me how you live!&quot;
:But his words impressed my ear no more
:Than if it were a sieve.

:He said, &quot;I look for soap-bubbles,
:That lie among the wheat,
:And bake them into mutton-pies,
:And sell them in the street.
:I sell them unto men,&quot; he said,
:&quot;Who sail on stormy seas;
:And that's the way I get my bread –
:A trifle, if you please.&quot;

:But I was thinking of a way
:To multiply by ten,
:And always, in the answer, get
:The question back again.
:I did not hear a word he said,
:But kicked that old man calm,
:And said, &quot;Come, tell me how you live!&quot;
:And pinched him in the arm.

:His accents mild took up the tale:
:He said, &quot;I go my ways,
:And when I find a mountain-rill,
:I set it in a blaze.
:And thence they make a stuff they call
:Rowland's Macassar Oil;
:But fourpence-halfpenny is all
:They give me for my toil.&quot;

:But I was thinking of a plan
:To paint one's gaiters green,
:So much the color of the grass
:That they could ne'er be seen.
:I gave his ear a sudden box,
:And questioned him again,
:And tweaked his grey and reverend locks,
:And put him into pain.

:He said, &quot;I hunt for haddock's eyes
:Among the heather bright,
:And work them into waistcoat-buttons
:In the silent night.
:And these I do not sell for gold,
:Or coin or silver-mine,
:But for a copper-halfpenny,
:And that will purchase nine.

:&quot;I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
:Or set limed twigs for crabs;
:I sometimes search the flowery knolls
:For wheels of hansom cabs.
:And that's the way&quot; (he gave a wink)
:&quot;I get my living here,
:And very gladly will I drink
:Your Honour's health in beer.&quot;

:I heard him then, for I had just
:Completed my design
:To keep the Menai bridge from rust
:By boiling it in wine.
:I duly thanked him, ere I went,
:For all his stories queer,
:But chiefly for his kind intent
:To drink my health in beer.

:And now if e'er by chance I put
:My fingers into glue,
:Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
:Into a left-hand shoe;
:Or if a statement I aver
:Of which I am not sure,
:I think of that strange wanderer
:Upon the lonely moor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the official demonym for a resident of the U.S. state of Indiana}}
'''Hoosier''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|ʒ|ər}} is the official [[demonym]] for a resident of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]]. The origin of the term remains a matter of debate within the state,&lt;ref name=whatIsAHoosier/&gt; but &quot;Hoosier&quot; was in general use by the 1840s,&lt;ref name=H5/&gt; having been popularized by [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]] resident John Finley's 1833&lt;ref name=H5&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haller |first=Steve |date=Autumn 2008 |title=The Meanings of Hoosier.  175 Years and Counting |journal=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History |volume=20 |issue=4 |page=5 |publisher=[[Indiana Historical Society]] |location=[[Indianapolis]] |issn=1040-788X}}&lt;/ref&gt; poem &quot;The Hoosier's Nest&quot;. Anyone born in Indiana or a resident at the time is considered to be a Hoosier.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoosiersNest&quot;&gt;Finley, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UYgtAAAAMAAJ The Hoosier's Nest and Other Poems]'', pp. 11&amp;ndash;17. Moore, Wilstach, &amp; Baldwin (Cincinnati), 1866. Accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana adopted the nickname &quot;The [[Hoosier State]]&quot; more than 150 years ago.&lt;ref name=whatIsAHoosier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gov/history/2612.htm |title=What is a Hoosier? |publisher=[[Indiana Historical Bureau]] |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Hoosier&quot; is used in the names of numerous Indiana-based businesses and organizations. &quot;Hoosiers&quot; is also the [[athletic nickname|name]] of the [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana University athletic teams]] and seven active and one disbanded [[athletic conferences]] in the [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]] have the word &quot;Hoosier&quot; in their name.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As there is no accepted embodiment of a Hoosier, the IU schools are represented through their letters and colors alone. In addition to universal acceptance by residents of Indiana, the term is also the official demonym according to the [[U.S. Government Publishing Office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usgpo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/12/hoosiers-indianians-government-printing-office-style-guide-indiana/96461434/ |title=Don't Call Them Indianians; They're Hoosiers |last=Groppe |first=Maureen |date=January 12, 2017 |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 12, 2017, the Federal Government officially changed the nickname of people from the state of Indiana from &quot;Indianans&quot; to &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, making Indiana the first state not to have a version of their state name in their nickname (&quot;Illinoisans&quot;, &quot;Texans&quot;, etc.).

==Origin==
In addition to &quot;The Hoosier's Nest&quot;, the term also appeared in the ''[[Indianapolis Journal]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;Carrier's Address&quot; on January 1, 1833. There are many suggestions for the derivation of the word, but none is universally accepted.

===Scholarship===
{{anchor|yokel}}
In 1900, [[Meredith Nicholson]] wrote ''The Hoosiers'', an early attempt to study the [[etymology]] of the word as applied to Indiana residents. [[Jacob Piatt Dunn]], longtime secretary of the [[Indiana Historical Society]], published ''The Word Hoosier'', a similar attempt, in 1907.&lt;ref name=twh&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/internet/extra/hoosier.html | title=The Word Hoosier | publisher=[[Indiana University Bloomington]] | accessdate=March 17, 2012 | author=Graf, Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both chronicled some of the popular and satirical etymologies circulating at the time and focused much of their attention on the use of the word in the [[Upland South]] to refer to woodsmen, yokels, and rough people. Dunn traced the word back to the [[Cumbrian dialect|Cumbrian]] ''hoozer'', meaning anything unusually large, derived from the [[Old English]] ''hoo'' (as at [[Sutton Hoo]]), meaning &quot;high&quot; and &quot;hill&quot;. The importance of immigrants from northern [[England]] and southern [[Scotland]] was reflected in numerous placenames including the [[Cumberland Mountains]], the [[Cumberland River]], and the [[Cumberland Gap]].&lt;ref name=whatIsAHoosier /&gt; Nicholson defended the people of Indiana against such an association, while Dunn concluded that the early settlers had adopted the nickname self-mockingly and that it had lost its negative associations by the time of Finley's poem.&lt;ref name=H6&gt;Haller, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnathan Clark Smith subsequently showed that Nicholson and Dunn's earliest sources within Indiana were mistaken. A letter by James Curtis cited by Dunn and others as the earliest known use of the term was actually written in 1846, not 1826. Similarly, the use of the term in an 1859 newspaper item quoting an 1827 diary entry by Sandford Cox was more likely an editorial comment and not from the original diary. Smith's earliest sources led him to argue that the word originated as a term along the [[Ohio River]] for [[flatboat]]men from Indiana and did not acquire its pejorative meanings until 1836, ''after'' Finley's poem.&lt;ref name=&quot;smithNotSouthernScorn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/12270/18247 | title=Not Southern Scorn but Local Pride: The Origin of the Word Hoosier and Indiana's River Culture | author=Smith, Jonathan Clark | journal=[[Indiana Magazine of History]] |date=June 2007 | volume=103 | issue=2 | pages=183&amp;ndash;194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Harry Hoosier|Black Harry}}
William Piersen, a history professor at [[Fisk University]], argued for a connection to the [[African American|black]] [[Methodist]] minister [[Reverend#Methodist|Rev]]. [[Harry Hosier]] ({{c.|lk=no|1750}}–May 1806), who evangelized the American frontier at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the [[Second Great Awakening]]. &quot;Black Harry&quot; had been born a slave in [[North Carolina]] and sold north to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], before gaining his freedom and beginning his ministry around the end of the [[American Revolution]]. He was a close associate and personal friend of [[Bishop (Methodist)|Bishop]] [[Francis Asbury]], the &quot;Father of the American Methodist Church&quot;. Dr.&amp;thinsp;[[Benjamin Rush]] said that, &quot;making allowances for his illiteracy, he was the greatest orator in America&quot;&lt;ref name=blah&gt;Webb, Stephen H. &quot;[http://dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/imh/printable/VAA4025-098-1-a02 Introducing Black Harry Hoosier: The History Behind Indiana's Namesake]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&quot;. ''Indiana Magazine of History'', Vol. XCVIII (March 2002). Trustees of Indiana University. Accessed 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and his sermons called on Methodists to reject [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and champion the common working man. Piersen proposed that Methodist communities inspired by his example took or were given a variant spelling of his name (possibly influenced by the &quot;yokel&quot; slang&lt;ref name=blah/&gt;) during the decades after his ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;piersenHarryHoosier&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Origin of the Word &quot;Hoosier&quot;: A New Interpretation | author=Piersen, William D. | journal=[[Indiana Magazine of History]] |date=June 1995 | volume=91 | issue=2 | postscript=, cited in Jeffrey Graf. &quot;The Word Hoosier&quot;. [[Indiana University Bloomington]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jorge Santander Serrano, a PhD student from [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] has also suggested that &quot;Hoosier&quot; might come from the [[French language|French]] words for redness &quot;''rougeur''&quot; or red-faced &quot;''rougeaud''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2016/11/its-a-rouguer-nation|title=GUEST COLUMN: It's a &quot;rouguer&quot; nation? The mystery behind Indiana's favorite nickname|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the early pejorative use of the word &quot;Hoosier&quot; may have a link to the color red (&quot;rouge&quot; in French) which is associated with [[indigenous peoples]], pejoratively called “red men” or “[[Redskin (slang)|red-skins]]”, and also with poor white people by calling them “[[Redneck|red-necks]].”

===Folk etymologies===
{{anchor|folklore}}
====Banter====
Humorous [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]] for the term &quot;hoosier&quot; have a long history, as recounted by Dunn in ''The Word Hoosier''.

One account traces the word to the necessary caution of approaching houses on the frontier. In order to avoid being shot, a traveler would call out from afar to let themselves be known. The inhabitants of the [[log cabin|cabin]] would then reply &quot;Who's here?&quot; which {{ndash}} in the [[Appalachian English]] of the early settlers {{ndash}} slurred into &quot;Who'sh 'ere?&quot; and thence into &quot;Hoosier?&quot; A variant of this account had the Indiana pioneers calling out &quot;Who'sh 'ere?&quot; as a general greeting and warning when hearing someone in the bushes and tall grass, to avoid shooting a relative or friend in error.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Indiana''. Textbook. {{c.|lk=no|1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] facetiously suggested that the fierce brawling that took place in Indiana involved enough biting that the expression &quot;Whose ear?&quot; became notable. This arose from or inspired the story of two 19th-century French immigrants brawling in a tavern in the foothills of southern Indiana. One was cut and a third Frenchman walked in to see an ear on the dirt floor of the tavern, prompting him to slur out &quot;Whosh ear?&quot;&lt;ref name=tri/&gt;

====Mr. Hoosier's men====
[[Image:Portland1850s.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One possible origin of the term &quot;Hoosier&quot; came from the construction of the [[Louisville and Portland Canal]] (1826–1833).]]
Two related stories trace the origin of the term to gangs of workers from Indiana under the direction of a Mr. Hoosier.

The account related by Dunn&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; is that a Louisville contractor named Samuel Hoosier preferred to hire workers from communities on the Indiana side of the Ohio River like [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]] rather than Kentuckians. During the excavation of the [[Louisville and Portland Canal|first canal]] around the [[Falls of the Ohio]] from 1826 to 1833, his employees became known as &quot;Hoosier's men&quot; and then simply &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. The usage spread from these hard-working laborers to all of the Indiana boatmen in the area and then spread north with the settlement of the state. The story was told to Dunn in 1901 by a man who had heard it from a Hoosier relative while traveling in southern [[Tennessee]]. Dunn could not find any family of the given name in any directory in the region or anyone else in southern Tennessee who had heard the story and accounted himself dubious. This version was subsequently retold by [[list of Hoosier governors|Gov]].&amp;thinsp;[[Evan Bayh]] and [[list of Hoosier senators|Sen]].&amp;thinsp;[[Vance Hartke]], who introduced the story into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' in 1975,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Graf.&lt;/ref&gt; and matches the timing and location of Smith's subsequent research. However, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] has been unable to find any record of a Hoosier or Hosier in surviving canal company records.&lt;ref name=tri&gt;Johnson, Leland &amp; al.''Triumph at the Falls: The Louisville and Portland Canal'', p. 42. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Louisville), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The word &quot;hoosier&quot; is still used in [[Greater St. Louis]] to denote a &quot;[[yokel]]&quot; or &quot;[[white trash]]&quot;.{{refn|{{quote|text=Thomas E. Murray carefully analyzed the use of &quot;hoosier&quot; in St. Louis, Missouri, where it is the favorite epithet of abuse. &quot;When asked what a Hoosier is,&quot; Murray writes, &quot;St. Louisans readily list a number of defining characteristics, among which are 'lazy,' 'slow-moving,' 'derelict,' and 'irresponsible.'&quot; He continues, &quot;Few epithets in St. Louis carry the pejorative connotations or the potential for eliciting negative responses that hoosier does.&quot; He conducted tests and interviews across lines of age and race and tabulated the results. He found the term ecumenically applied. He also noted the word was often used with a modifier, almost redundantly, as in &quot;some damn Hoosier.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a separate section Murray speaks of the history of the word and cites Baker and Carmony (1975) and speculates on why Hoosier (in Indiana a &quot;neutral or, more often, positive&quot; term) should remain &quot;alive and well in St. Louis, occupying as it does the honored position of being the city's number one term of derogation.&quot; A radio broadcast took up where Murray left off. During the program ''[[Fresh Air]]'', [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], a language commentator, answered questions about regional nicknames. He cited [[Elaine Viets]], a ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|Post-Dispatch]]'' columnist (also quoted by Paul Dickson), as saying that in St. Louis a &quot;Hoosier is a low-life [[redneck]], somebody you can recognize because they have a car on concrete blocks in their front yard and are likely to have just shot their wife who may also be their sister.&quot;|sign=Jeffrey Graff|source=&quot;The Word Hoosier&quot;&lt;ref name=twh/&gt;}}}} The word is also encountered in [[sea shanties]]. In the book ''[[Sea shanty#Stan Hugill and Shanties from the Seven Seas|Shanties from the Seven Seas]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;hugillShanties&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Shanties from the Seven Seas | publisher=Mystic Seaport Museum | author=Hugill, Stan | year=1961 | location=Mystic, Connecticut | isbn=0913372706}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stan Hugill, in reference to its former use to denote [[cotton]]-stowers, who would move bales of cotton to and from the holds of ships and force them in tightly by means of [[jackscrew]]s. &quot;To hoosier&quot; is sometimes still encountered as a verb meaning &quot;to trick&quot; or &quot;to swindle&quot;.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A [[Hoosier cabinet]], often shortened to &quot;hoosier&quot;, is a type of free-standing kitchen cabinet popular in the early decades of the twentieth century. Almost all of these cabinets were produced by companies located in Indiana and the name derives from the largest of them, the Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of [[New Castle, Indiana]]. Other Indiana businesses include [[Hoosier Racing Tire]] and the Hoosier Bat Company, manufacturer of wooden [[baseball bat]]s.

The [[RCA Dome]], former home of the [[Indianapolis Colts]], was known as the &quot;Hoosier Dome&quot; before [[RCA]] purchased the [[naming rights]] in 1994. The RCA Dome was replaced by [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], '''Horner's method''' (also known as '''Horner scheme''' in the UK or '''Horner's rule''' in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cormen et al.&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|Stein|2009|pages=41, 900, 990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HornerRule&quot;&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=HornersRule|title=Horner's Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is either of two things:
* an [[algorithm]] for calculating [[polynomial]]s, which consists of transforming the [[Monomial basis|monomial form]] into a computationally efficient form;&lt;ref name=&quot;HornerRule&quot; /&gt; or
* a method for approximating the roots of a polynomial.&lt;ref name=&quot;HornerMethod&quot;&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=HornersMethod|title=Horner's Method}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter is also known as '''Ruffini–Horner's method'''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:fr:Méthode de Ruffini-Horner|Méthode de Ruffini-Horner]] on French Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

These methods are named after the British mathematician [[William George Horner]], although they were known before him by [[Paolo Ruffini]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cajori&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, six hundred years earlier, by the Chinese mathematician [[Qin Jiushao]].&lt;ref&gt;''It is obvious that this procedure is a Chinese invention'', in {{harvnb|Libbrecht|2005|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the algorithm ==

Given the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots + a_n x^n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, we wish to evaluate the polynomial at a specific value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

To accomplish this, we define a new sequence of constants as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
b_n &amp; := a_n \\
b_{n-1} &amp; := a_{n-1} + b_n x_0 \\
&amp; {}\  \  \vdots \\
b_0 &amp; := a_0 + b_1 x_0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;p(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

To see why this works, note that the polynomial can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + \cdots + x(a_{n-1} + a_n x))). &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, by iteratively substituting the &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; into the expression,
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p(x_0) &amp; = a_0 + x_0(a_1 + x_0(a_2 + \cdots + x_0(a_{n-1} + b_n x_0))) \\
&amp; = a_0 + x_0(a_1 + x_0(a_2 + \cdots + x_0(b_{n-1}))) \\
&amp; {} \ \  \vdots \\
&amp; = a_0 + x_0(b_1) \\
&amp; = b_0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

Evaluate &lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x^3-6x^2+2x-1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x=3.&lt;/math&gt;

We use [[synthetic division]] as follows:

  ''x''₀│   ''x''³    ''x''²    ''x''¹    ''x''⁰
  3 │   2    −6     2    −1
    │         6     0     6
    └────────────────────────
        2     0     2     5

The entries in the third row are the sum of those in the first two. Each entry in the second row is the product of the ''x''-value (3 in this example) with the third-row entry immediately to the left. The entries in the first row are the coefficients of the polynomial to be evaluated. Then the remainder of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; on division by &lt;math&gt;x-3&lt;/math&gt; is 5.

But by the [[polynomial remainder theorem]], we know that the remainder is &lt;math&gt;f(3) &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;f(3) = 5&lt;/math&gt;

In this example, if &lt;math&gt;a_3 = 2, a_2 = -6, a_1 = 2, a_0 = -1&lt;/math&gt; we can see that &lt;math&gt;b_3 = 2, b_2 = 0, b_1 = 2, b_0 = 5 &lt;/math&gt;, the entries in the third row. So, synthetic division is based on Horner's method.

As a consequence of the polynomial remainder theorem, the entries in the third row are the coefficients of the second-degree polynomial, the quotient of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; on division by &lt;math&gt; x-3 &lt;/math&gt;. 
The remainder is 5. This makes Horner's method useful for [[polynomial long division]].

Divide &lt;math&gt;x^3-6x^2+11x-6&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x-2&lt;/math&gt;:

  2 │   1    −6    11    −6
    │         2    −8     6
    └────────────────────────
        1    −4     3     0

The quotient is &lt;math&gt;x^2-4x+3&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)=4x^4-6x^3+3x-5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)=2x-1&lt;/math&gt;. Divide &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f_2\,(x)&lt;/math&gt; using Horner's method.

   2 │  4    −6    0    3   │   −5
 ────┼──────────────────────┼───────
   1 │        2   −2   −1   │    1
     └──────────────────────┼───────
        2    −2   −1    1   │   −4

The third row is the sum of the first two rows, divided by 2. Each entry in the second row is the product of 1 with the third-row entry to the left. The answer is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_1(x)}{f_2(x)}=2x^3-2x^2-x+1-\frac{4}{2x-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Floating point multiplication and division===
{{main|multiplication algorithm#Shift and add}}

Horner's method is a fast, code-efficient method for multiplication and division of binary numbers on a [[microcontroller]] with no [[binary multiplier|hardware multiplier]].  One of the binary numbers to be multiplied is represented as a trivial polynomial, where, (using the above notation):  a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, and x = 2.  Then, x (or x to some power) is repeatedly factored out.  In this [[binary numeral system]] (base 2), x = 2, so powers of 2 are repeatedly factored out.

====Example====
For example, to find the product of two numbers, (0.15625) and ''m'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
( 0.15625) m &amp; = (0.00101_b) m = ( 2^{-3} + 2^{-5}) m = (2^{-3})m + (2^{-5})m \\[4pt]
&amp; = 2^{-3} (m + (2^{-2})m) = 2^{-3} (m + 2^{-2} (m)).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Method====
To find the product of two binary numbers, d and m:
*1. A register holding the intermediate result is initialized to d.
*2. Begin with the least significant (rightmost) non-zero bit in m.
**2b. Count (to the left) the number of bit positions to the next most significant non-zero bit.  If there are no more-significant bits, then take the value of the current bit position.
**2c. Using that value, perform a left-shift operation by that number of bits on the register holding the intermediate result
*3. If all the non-zero bits were counted, then the intermediate result register now holds the final result.  Otherwise, add d to the intermediate result, and continue in step #2 with the next most significant bit in m.

====Derivation====
In general, for a binary number with bit values: (&lt;math&gt; d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0 &lt;/math&gt;) the product is:
:&lt;math&gt; (d_3 2^3 + d_2 2^2 + d_1 2^1 + d_0 2^0)m = d_3 2^3 m + d_2 2^2 m + d_1 2^1 m + d_0 2^0 m &lt;/math&gt;
At this stage in the algorithm, it is required that terms with zero-valued coefficients are dropped, so that only binary coefficients equal to one are counted, thus the problem of multiplication or [[division by zero]] is not an issue, despite this implication in the factored equation:

:&lt;math&gt; = d_0\left(m + 2 \frac{d_1}{d_0} \left(m + 2 \frac{d_2}{d_1} \left(m + 2 \frac{d_3}{d_2} (m)\right)\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

The denominators all equal one (or the term is absent), so this reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt; = d_0(m + 2 {d_1} (m + 2 {d_2} (m + 2 {d_3} (m)))),&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently (as consistent with the &quot;method&quot; described above):
:&lt;math&gt; = d_3(m + 2^{-1} {d_2} (m + 2^{-1}{d_1} (m + {d_0} (m)))). &lt;/math&gt;

In binary (base 2) math, multiplication by a power of 2 is merely a [[arithmetic shift|register shift]] operation.  Thus, multiplying by 2 is calculated in base-2 by an [[arithmetic shift]].  The factor (2&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is a right [[arithmetic shift]], a (0) results in no operation (since 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, is the multiplicative [[identity element]]), and a (2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) results in a left arithmetic shift.
The multiplication product can now be quickly calculated using only arithmetic shift operations, addition and subtraction.

The method is particularly fast on processors supporting a single-instruction shift-and-addition-accumulate.  Compared to a C floating-point library, Horner's method sacrifices some accuracy, however it is nominally 13 times faster (16 times faster when the &quot;[[canonical signed digit]]&quot; (CSD) form is used), and uses only 20% of the code space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kripasagar|2008|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polynomial root finding ===
Using Horner's method in combination with [[Newton's method]], it is possible to approximate the real roots of a polynomial. The algorithm works as follows. Given a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with zeros &lt;math&gt; z_n &lt; z_{n-1} &lt; \cdots &lt; z_1,&lt;/math&gt; make some initial guess &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x_0 &gt; z_1 &lt;/math&gt;. Now iterate the following two steps:

1. Using [[Newton's method]], find the largest zero &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; using the guess &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

2. Using Horner's method, divide out &lt;math&gt;(x-z_1)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;p_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Return to step 1 but use the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and the initial guess &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;.

These two steps are repeated until all real zeros are found for the polynomial. If the approximated zeros are not precise enough, the obtained values can be used as initial guesses for Newton's method but using the full polynomial rather than the reduced polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kress|1991|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example ====

[[File:HornerandNewton.gif|thumb|right|500px|Polynomial root finding using Horner's method]]

Consider the polynomial

: &lt;math&gt;
p_6(x) = (x-3)(x+3)(x+5)(x+8)(x-2)(x-7)
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be expanded to

: &lt;math&gt;
p_6(x) = x^6 + 4x^5 - 72x^4 -214x^3 + 1127x^2 + 1602x -5040.
&lt;/math&gt;

From the above we know that the largest root of this polynomial is 7 so we are able to make an initial guess of 8. Using Newton's method the first zero of 7 is found as shown in black in the figure to the right. Next &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is divided by &lt;math&gt;(x-7)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
p_5(x) = x^5 + 11x^4 + 5x^3 - 179x^2 - 126x + 720
&lt;/math&gt;

which is drawn in red in the figure to the right. Newton's method is used to find the largest zero of this polynomial with an initial guess of 7. The largest zero of this polynomial which corresponds to the second largest zero of the original polynomial is found at 3 and is circled in red. The degree 5 polynomial is now divided by &lt;math&gt;(x-3)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
p_4(x) = x^4 + 14x^3 + 47x^2 - 38x - 240
&lt;/math&gt;

which is shown in yellow. The zero for this polynomial is found at 2 again using Newton's method and is circled in yellow. Horner's method is now used to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
p_3(x) = x^3 + 16x^2 + 79x + 120
&lt;/math&gt;

which is shown in green and found to have a zero at&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;3. This polynomial is further reduced to

: &lt;math&gt;
p_2(x) = x^2 + 13x + 40
&lt;/math&gt;

which is shown in blue and yields a zero of&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;5. The final root of the original polynomial may be found by either using the final zero as an initial guess for Newton's method, or by reducing &lt;math&gt;p_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; and solving the linear equation. As can be seen, the expected roots of &amp;minus;8, &amp;minus;5, &amp;minus;3, 2, 3, and 7 were found.

==== Octave implementation ====
The following [[GNU Octave|Octave]] code was used in the example above to implement Horner's method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;octave&quot;&gt;
function [y b] = horner(a,x)
  % Input a is the polynomial coefficient vector, x the value to be evaluated at.
  % The output y is the evaluated polynomial and b the divided coefficient vector.
  b(1) = a(1);
  for i = 2:length(a)
    b(i) = a(i)+x*b(i-1);
  end
  y = b(length(a));
  b = b(1:length(b)-1);
end
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Python implementation ====

The following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code implements Horner's method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def horner(x, *polynomial):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A function that implements the Horner Scheme for evaluating a
    polynomial of coefficients *polynomial in x.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    result = 0
    for coefficient in polynomial:
        result = result * x + coefficient
    return result
&lt;/source&gt;

==== C implementation ====

The following [[C (programming language)|C]] code implements Horner's method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
double HornerEvaluate (double x, double * CoefficientsOfPolynomial, unsigned int DegreeOfPolynomial)
{
    /*
        We want to evaluate the polynomial in x, of coefficients CoefficientsOfPolynomial, using Horner's method.
        The result is stored in dbResult.
    */
    double dbResult = 0.0;
    int i;
    for(i = DegreeOfPolynomial; i &gt;= 0; i--)
    {
        dbResult = dbResult * x + CoefficientsOfPolynomial[i];
    }
    return dbResult;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a slightly optimized version using explicit fused [[Multiply–accumulate operation]], often execute faster than the above when running on a computer built with a processor supporting FMA instruction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// gcc -std=c11 -lm horner.c -o horner
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

double horner_fma(double x, const double *coeffs, size_t count)
{
    double result = 0.0;
    for (int idx = count-1; idx &gt;= 0; idx--)
        result = fma(result, x, coeffs[idx]);
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====  C# implementation ====

The following C# code implements Horner's method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;
public double HornerEvaluate(int[] numbers, double x)
{
	double result = 0;
	
	for(int i = numbers.Length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
	{
		result = result * x + numbers[i];
	}
	
	return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Application ==

Horner's method can be used to convert between different positional [[numeral system]]s – in which case ''x'' is the base of the number system, and the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; coefficients are the digits of the base-''x'' representation of a given number – and can also be used if ''x'' is a [[matrix (math)|matrix]], in which case the gain in computational efficiency is even greater. In fact, when ''x'' is a matrix, further acceleration is possible which exploits the structure of [[matrix multiplication]], and only &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''n'' multiplies are needed (at the expense of requiring more storage) using the 1973 method of Paterson and Stockmeyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2002|loc=Section 5.4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==

Evaluation using the monomial form of a degree-''n'' polynomial requires at most ''n'' additions and (''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'')/2 multiplications, if powers are calculated by repeated multiplication and each monomial is evaluated individually.  (This can be reduced to ''n'' additions and 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 multiplications by evaluating the powers of ''x'' iteratively.)  If numerical data are represented in terms of digits (or bits), then the naive algorithm also entails storing approximately 2''n'' times the number of bits of ''x'' (the evaluated polynomial has approximate magnitude ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and one must also store ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; itself).  By contrast, Horner's method requires only ''n'' additions and ''n'' multiplications, and its storage requirements are only ''n'' times the number of bits of ''x''. Alternatively, Horner's method can be computed with ''n'' [[fused multiply–add]]s.  Horner's method can also be extended to evaluate the first ''k'' derivatives of the polynomial with ''kn'' additions and multiplications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pankiewicz|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horner's method is optimal, in the sense that any algorithm to evaluate an arbitrary polynomial must use at least as many operations. [[Alexander Ostrowski]] proved in 1954 that the number of additions required is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostrowski|1954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Pan]] proved in 1966 that the number of multiplications is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pan|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when ''x'' is a matrix, Horner's method is not optimal{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

This assumes that the polynomial is evaluated in monomial form and no [[preconditioning]] of the representation is allowed, which makes sense if the polynomial is evaluated only once. However, if preconditioning is allowed and the polynomial is to be evaluated many times, then faster algorithms are possible. They involve a transformation of the representation of the polynomial. In general, a degree-''n'' polynomial can be evaluated using only &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle{\left\lfloor n/2 \right\rfloor + 2}}&lt;/math&gt; multiplications and ''n'' additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horner's paper entitled &quot;A new method of solving numerical equations of all orders, by continuous approximation&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horner&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Horner|1819}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was read before the Royal Society of London, at its meeting on July 1, 1819, with [[Davies Gilbert]], Vice-President and Treasurer, in the chair; this was the final [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015014105277?urlappend=%3Bseq=158 meeting] of the session before the Society adjorned for its Summer recess. When a sequel was read before the Society in 1823, it was again at the final meeting of the session. On both occasions, papers by [[James Ivory (mathematician)|James Ivory]], FRS, were also read. In 1819, it was Horner's paper that got through to publication in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horner&quot; /&gt; later in the year, Ivory's paper falling by the way, despite Ivory being a Fellow; in 1823, when a total of ten papers were read, fortunes as regards publication, were reversed. But Gilbert, who had strong connections with the West of England and may have had social contact with Horner, resident as Horner was in Bristol and Bath, published his own [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Gilbert1823QJSLA.pdf survey] of Horner-type methods earlier in 1823.

Horner's paper in Part II of ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' for 1819 was warmly and expansively welcomed by a [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Horner1820MonthlyRev91-4.pdf reviewer] in the issue of ''The Monthly Review: or, Literary Journal'' for April, 1820; in comparison, a technical paper by [[Charles Babbage]] is dismissed curtly in this review. However, the reviewer noted that another, similar method had also recently been published by the architect and mathematical expositor, Peter Nicholson. This theme is developed in a further [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Horner1820MonthlyRev93-12.pdf review] of some of Nicholson's books in the issue of ''The Monthly Review'' for December, 1820, which in turn ends with notice of the appearance of a booklet by Theophilus Holdred, from whom Nicholson acknowledges he obtained the gist of his approach in the first place, although claiming to have improved upon it. The sequence of reviews is concluded in the issue of ''The Monthly Review'' for September, 1821, with the [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Horner1821MonthlyRev96-9.pdf reviewer] concluding that whereas Holdred was the first person to discover a direct and general practical solution of numerical equations, he had not reduced it to its simplest form by the time of Horner's publication, and saying that had Holdred published forty years earlier when he first discovered his method, his contribution could be more easily recognized. The reviewer is exceptionally well-informed, even having sighted Horner's preparatory correspondence with [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] in 1818, seeking work of [[François Budan de Boislaurent|Budan]]. The Bodlean Library, Oxford has the Editor's annotated copy of ''The Monthly Review'' from which it is clear that the most active reviewer in mathematics in 1814 and 1815 (the last years for which this information has been published) was none other than Peter Barlow,one of the foremost specialists on approximation theory of the period, suggesting that it was Barlow, who wrote this sequence of reviews. As it also happened, Henry Atkinson, of Newcastle, devised a similar approximation scheme in 1809; he had consulted his fellow [[Geordie]], [[Charles Hutton]], another specialist and a senior colleague of Barlow at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, only to be advised that, while his work was publishable, it was unlikely to have much impact. J. R. Young, writing in the mid-1830s, concluded that Holdred's first method replicated Atkinson's while his improved method was only added to Holdred's booklet some months after its first appearance in 1820, when Horner's paper was already in circulation.

The feature of Horner's writing that most distinguishes it from his English contemporaries is the way he draws on the Continental literature, notably the work of [[Louis François Antoine Arbogast|Arbogast]]. The advocacy, as well as the detraction, of Horner's Method has this as an unspoken subtext. Quite how he gained that familiarity has not been determined. Horner is known to have made a close reading of John Bonneycastle's book on algebra. Bonneycastle recognizes that Arbogast has the general, combinatorial expression for the reversion of series, a project going back at least to Newton. But Bonneycastle's main purpose in mentioning Arbogast is not to praise him, but to observe that Arbogast's notation is incompatible with the approach he adopts. The gap in Horner's reading was the work of [[Paolo Ruffini]], except that, as far as awareness of Ruffini goes, citations of Ruffini's work by authors, including medical authors, in ''Philosophical Transactions'' speak volumes: there are none - Ruffini's [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101013501372?urlappend=%3Bseq=695 name] only appears in 1814, recording a work he donated to the Royal Society. Ruffini might have done better if his work had appeared in French, as had [[Malfatti's problem|Malfatti's Problem]] in the reformulation of [[Gergonne|Joseph Diaz Gergonne]], or had he written in French, as had [[:it:Antonio Cagnoli|Antonio Cagnoli]], a source quoted by Bonneycastle on series reversion (today, Cagnoli is in the Italian Wikipedia, as shown, but has yet to make it into either French or English).

Fuller&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fuller|1999|pages=29–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the method in Horner's 1819 paper differs from what afterwards became known as 'Horner's method' and that in consequence the priority for this method should go to Holdred (1920). This view may be compared with the remarks concerning the works of Horner and Holdred in the previous paragraph. Fuller also takes aim at [[Augustus De Morgan]]. Precocious though Augustus de Morgan was, he was not the reviewer for ''The Monthly Review'', while several others - [[Thomas Stephens Davies]], J. R. Young, Stephen Fenwick, T. T. Wilkinson - wrote Horner firmly into their records, not least Horner himself, as he published extensively up until the year of his death in 1837. His paper in 1819 was one that would have been difficult to miss. In contrast, the only other mathematical sighting of Holdred is a single named contribution to ''The Gentleman's Mathematical Companion'', an answer to a problem.

It is questionable to what extent it was De Morgan's advocacy of Horner's priority in discovery&lt;ref name=&quot;Cajori&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;St Andrews&quot; /&gt; that led to &quot;Horner's method&quot; being so called in textbooks, but it is true that those suggesting this tend themselves to know of Horner largely through intermediaries, of whom De Morgan made himself a prime example. However, this method ''qua'' method was known long before Horner. In reverse chronological order, Horner's method was already known to:

* [[Paolo Ruffini]] in 1809 (see [[Ruffini's rule]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Cajori&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;St Andrews&quot;&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Horner}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Isaac Newton]] in 1669 (but precise reference needed)
* the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Zhu Shijie]] in the 14th century&lt;ref name=&quot;St Andrews&quot; /&gt;
* the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Qin Jiushao]] in his ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]'' in the 13th century
* the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] in the 12th century (the first to use that method in a general case of cubic equation)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berggren|1990|pages = 304–309}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Chinese mathematician [[Jia Xian]] in the 11th century ([[Song dynasty]])
* ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', a Chinese work of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC &amp;ndash; 220 AD) edited by [[Liu Hui]] (fl. 3rd century).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|1986|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this observation on its own masks significant differences in conception and also, as noted with Ruffini's work, issues of accessibility.

[[Qin Jiushao]], in his ''Shu Shu Jiu Zhang'' (''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]''; 1247), presents a portfolio of methods of Horner-type for solving polynomial equations, which was based on earlier works of the 11th century Song dynasty mathematician [[Jia Xian]]; for example, one method is specifically suited to bi-quintics, of which Qin gives an instance, in keeping with the then Chinese custom of case studies. The first person writing in English to note the connection with Horner's method was [[Alexander Wylie (missionary)|Alexander Wylie]], writing in ''The North China Herald'' in 1852; perhaps conflating and misconstruing different Chinese phrases, Wylie calls the method ''Harmoniously Alternating Evolution'' (which does not agree with his Chinese, ''linglong kaifang'', not that at that date he uses [[pinyin]]), working the case of one of Qin's quartics and giving, for comparison, the working with Horner's method. [[Yoshio Mikami]] in ''Development of Mathematics in China and Japan'' published in Leipzig in 1913, gave a detailed description of Qin's method, using the quartic illustrated to the above right in a worked example; he wrote: &quot;who can deny the fact of Horner's illustrious process being used in China at least nearly six long centuries earlier than in Europe ... We of course don't intend in any way to ascribe Horner's invention to a Chinese origin, but the lapse of time sufficiently makes it not altogether impossible that the Europeans could have known of the Chinese method in a direct or indirect way.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mikami|1913|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Mikami is also aware, it was ''not altogether impossible'' that a related work, ''Si Yuan Yu Jian'' (''Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns; 1303)'' by [[Zhu Shijie]] might make the shorter journey across to Japan, but seemingly it never did, although another work of Zhu, ''Suan Xue Qi Meng'', had a seminal influence on the development of traditional mathematics in the Edo period, starting in the mid-1600s. [[Ulrich Libbrecht]] (at the time teaching in school, but subsequently a professor of comparative philosophy) gave a detailed description in his doctoral thesis of Qin's method, he concluded: ''It is obvious that this procedure is a Chinese invention....the method was not known in India''. He said, Fibonacci probably learned of it from Arabs, who perhaps borrowed from the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libbrecht|2005|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the problems is that there is no more evidence for this speculation than there is of the method being known in India. Of course, the extraction of square and cube roots along similar lines is already discussed by [[Liu Hui]] in connection with Problems IV.16 and 22 in ''Jiu Zhang Suan Shu'', while [[Wang Xiaotong]] in the 7th century supposes his readers can solve cubics by an approximation method described in his book [[Jigu Suanjing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''Hapworth 16, 1924'''&quot; was the last original work of Salinger's to be published in his lifetime. It appeared in the June 19, 1965, edition of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', infamously taking up almost the entire magazine. It is the &quot;youngest&quot; of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s [[Glass family]] stories, in the sense that the narrated events happen chronologically before those in the rest of the &quot;Glass series&quot;.   

Both contemporary and later literary critics harshly panned &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924&quot;; writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Michiko Kakutani]] called it &quot;a sour, implausible and, sad to say, completely charmless story .... filled with digressions, narcissistic asides and ridiculous shaggy-dog circumlocutions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/books/from-salinger-a-new-dash-of-mystery.html |title=From Salinger, A New Dash Of Mystery |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |date=20 February 1997 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |access-date= |quote=a sour, implausible and, sad to say, completely charmless story…filled with digressions, narcissistic asides and ridiculous shaggy-dog circumlocutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even kind critics have regarded the work as &quot;a long-winded sob story&quot; that many have found &quot;simply unreadable,&quot; and it has been speculated that this negative response was the reason Salinger decided to quit publishing.&lt;ref&gt;French (1986), pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt; But Salinger is also said to have considered the story a &quot;high point of his writing&quot; and made tentative steps to have it reprinted, though those came to nothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lathbury&quot;&gt;Lathbury (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is presented in the form of a [[Epistolary novel|letter]] from camp written by a seven-year-old [[Seymour Glass]] (the main character of &quot;[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]&quot;). In this respect, the plot is identical to Salinger's previous unpublished story &quot;[[The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls]]&quot;, written 18 years earlier in 1947. In the course of requesting an inordinate quantity of reading matter from home, Seymour predicts his brother's success as a writer as well as his own death and offers critical assessments of a number of major writers.

==Publishing history==
After the story's appearance in ''The New Yorker'', Salinger&amp;mdash;who had already withdrawn to his home in New Hampshire&amp;mdash;stopped publishing altogether. Since the story never appeared between hard covers, readers had to seek out that issue or find it on microfilm. Finally, with the release of ''The Complete New Yorker'' on DVD in 2005, the story was once again widely available.

In 1996, Orchises Press, a small Virginia publishing house, started a process of publishing &quot;Hapworth&quot; in book form. Orchises Press owner Roger Lathbury has described the effort in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and, three months after Salinger's death, in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine''.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Lathbury&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapira&quot;&gt;Shapira (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/65210/index1.html|title=Betraying Salinger|last=Lathbury|first=Roger|date=12 April 2010|website=nymag.com|publisher=New York Media, LLC|access-date=22 May 2010|quote=I scored the publishing coup of the decade: his final book. And then I blew it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lathbury, Salinger was deeply concerned with the proposed book's appearance, even visiting Washington to examine the cloth for the binding. Salinger also sent Lathbury numerous &quot;infectious and delightful and loving&quot; letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapira&quot;/&gt;

Following publishing norms, Lathbury applied for [[Library of Congress]] [[Cataloging in Publication]] data, unaware of how publicly available the information would be. A writer in Seattle, researching an article on [[Jeff Bezos]], came across the &quot;Hapworth&quot; publication date,&lt;ref&gt;Lundegaard (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and told his sister, a journalist for the ''[[Washington Business Journal]]'', who wrote an article about the upcoming book.&lt;ref&gt;Lundegaard (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; This led to substantial coverage in the press. Shortly before the books were to be shipped, Salinger changed his mind, and Orchises withdrew the book. New publication dates were repeatedly announced, but it never appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Noah (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Lathbury said, &quot;I never reached back out. I thought about writing some letters, but it wouldn't have done any good.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapira&quot; /&gt;

'''Hypnotic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Hypnos'', sleep) or '''soporific''' drugs, commonly known as '''sleeping pills''', are a class of [[psychoactive drug]]s whose primary function is to [[sleep induction|induce sleep]]&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:hypnotic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/four/000051451.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:hypnotic |website=Mercksource.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211091401/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=%2Fppdocs%2Fus%2Fcommon%2Fdorlands%2Fdorland%2Ffour%2F000051451.htm |archivedate=2008-12-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to be used in the treatment of [[insomnia]] (sleeplessness), or surgical [[anesthesia]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;When used in anesthesia to produce and maintain unconsciousness, &quot;sleep&quot; is metaphorical as there are no regular [[sleep stages]] or cyclical natural states; patients rarely recover from anesthesia feeling refreshed and with renewed energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

This group is related to '''[[sedative]]s'''. Where as the term ''sedative'' describes drugs that serve to calm or relieve anxiety, the term ''hypnotic'' generally describes drugs whose main purpose is to initiate, sustain, or lengthen sleep. Because these two functions frequently overlap, and because drugs in this class generally produce dose-dependent effects (ranging from [[anxiolysis]] to loss of consciousness) they are often referred to collectively as '''sedative-hypnotic''' drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunton |first=Laurence L. |last2=Lazo |first2=John S. |last3=Lazo Parker |first3=Keith L. |title=Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |place= |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |year=2006 |edition=11th |url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=374&amp;sectionid=41266223 |chapter=17: Hypnotics and Sedatives |isbn=0-07-146804-8 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypnotica''' was a class of somniferous drugs and substances tested in medicine of the 1890s and later, including: [[Carbamate|Urethan]], [[Acetal]], [[Methylal]], [[Sulfonal]], [[Paraldehyd]], [[Amylenhydrate]], [[Hypnon]], [[Chloralurethan]] and [[Ohloralamid]] or [[Chloralimid]].&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Record of Medicine and Surgery - Volume 5 - Page 36 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

Research about using medications to treat insomnia evolved throughout the last half of the 20th century. Treatment for insomnia in psychiatry dates back to 1869 when [[chloral hydrate]] was first used as a soporific.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-517668-5&quot; /&gt; [[Barbiturate]]s emerged as the first class of drugs that emerged in the early 1900s,&lt;ref name=&quot;rzepa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/drugs/html/barbiturate_text.htm |title=Barbiturates |accessdate=2007-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107090620/http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/drugs/html/barbiturate_text.htm |archivedate=7 November 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which chemical substitution allowed derivative compounds. Although the best drug family at the time (less toxic and with fewer side effects) they were dangerous in [[drug overdose|overdose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlock |first=F.

During the 1970s, [[quinazolinone]]s{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} and [[benzodiazepine]]s were introduced as safer alternatives to replace barbiturates; by the late 1970s benzodiazepines emerged as the safer drug.&lt;ref name=isbn0-19-517668-5&gt;{{cite book|last=Shorter |first=Edward |title=A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |chapter=Benzodiazepines |pages=41–2 |isbn=0-19-517668-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M49pEDoEpl0C&amp;pg=PA41 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines are not without their drawbacks; [[substance dependence]] is possible, and deaths from overdoses sometimes occur, especially in combination with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and/or other [[depressants]]. Questions have been raised as to whether they disturb sleep architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15783240&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbera |first1=J. |last2=Shapiro |first2=C. |title=Benefit-risk assessment of zaleplon in the treatment of insomnia |journal=Drug Saf |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=301–18 |year=2005 |pmid=15783240 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200528040-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s are the most recent development (1990s–present). Although it's clear that they are less toxic than their predecessors, barbiturates, comparative efficacy over benzodiazepines have not been established. Without [[longitudinal studies]], it is hard to determine; however some psychiatrists recommend these drugs, citing research suggesting they are equally potent with less potential for abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9640488a&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner |first1=J. |last2=Wagner |first2=M.

Other sleep remedies that may be considered &quot;sedative-hypnotics&quot; exist; psychiatrists will sometimes prescribe medicines [[off-label]] if they have sedating effects. Examples of these include [[mirtazapine]] (an antidepressant), [[clonidine]] (generally prescribed to regulate blood pressure), [[quetiapine]] (an antipsychotic), and the [[over-the-counter]] sleep aid [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl&amp;nbsp;– an antihistamine). Off-label sleep remedies are particularly useful when first-line treatment is unsuccessful or deemed unsafe (for example, in patients with a history of [[substance abuse]]).

==Types==

===Barbiturate===
{{Main article|Barbiturate}}
Barbiturates are drugs that act as [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]s, and can therefore produce a wide spectrum of effects, from mild [[sedation]] to total [[anesthesia]]. They are also effective as [[anxiolytic]]s, hypnotics, and [[anticonvulsalgesic]] effects; however, these effects are somewhat weak, preventing barbiturates from being used in [[surgery]] in the absence of other analgesics. They have dependence liability, both [[physical dependence|physical]] and [[psychological dependence|psychological]]. Barbiturates have now largely been replaced by [[benzodiazepine]]s in routine medical practice&amp;nbsp;– for example, in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia&amp;nbsp;– mainly because benzodiazepines are significantly less dangerous in [[drug overdose|overdose]]. However, barbiturates are still used in general anesthesia, for [[epilepsy]], and [[assisted suicide]]. Barbiturates are derivatives of [[barbituric acid]].

The principal [[mechanism of action]] of barbiturates is believed to be [[positive allosteric modulator|positive allosteric modulation]] of [[GABAA|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Löscher | first1 = W. | last2 = Rogawski | first2 = M.

Examples include [[amobarbital]], [[pentobarbital]], [[phenobarbital]], [[secobarbital]], and [[sodium thiopental]].

===Quinazolinones===
{{main article|Quinazolinone#Derivatives}}
{{See also|Methaqualone}}&lt;!--All other articles are currently stubs. This is the only substantial article we have. (February 2014)--&gt;

Quinazolinones are also a class of drugs which function as hypnotic/sedatives that contain a 4-quinazolinone core.  Their use has also been proposed in the treatment of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17172404&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen |first1=K. |last2=Wang |first2=K. |last3=Kirichian |first3=A.

Examples of quinazolinones include [[cloroqualone]], [[diproqualone]], [[etaqualone]] (Aolan, Athinazone, Ethinazone), [[mebroqualone]], [[mecloqualone]] (Nubarene, Casfen), and [[methaqualone]] (Quaalude).

===Benzodiazepines===
{{main article|Benzodiazepine#Insomnia}}
{{See also|List of benzodiazepines}}

Benzodiazepines can be useful for short-term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Appraisal Guidance 77.

While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt [[sleep architecture]]: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep [[slow-wave sleep]] (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The diagnosis and management of benzodiazepine dependence|journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date = 2005-05-01|issn = 0951-7367|pmid = 16639148|pages = 249–255|volume = 18|issue = 3|doi = 10.1097/01.yco.0000165594.60434.84|first = Heather|last = Ashton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Long-term outcome after discontinuation of benzodiazepines for insomnia: a survival analysis of relapse|journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 0005-7967|pmid = 15531349|pages = 1–14|volume = 43|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2003.12.002|first = Charles M.|last = Morin|first2 = Lynda|last2 = Bélanger|first3 = Célyne|last3 = Bastien|first4 = Annie|last4 = Vallières}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic benzodiazepine usage and withdrawal in insomnia patients|journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research|date = 2004-06-01|issn = 0022-3956|pmid = 15003439|pages = 327–334|volume = 38|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2003.10.003|first = Dalva|last = Poyares|first2 = Christian|last2 = Guilleminault|first3 = Maurice M.|last3 = Ohayon|first4 = Sergio|last4 = Tufik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, [[rebound insomnia]], and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook_of_integrative&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=D.

The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ahrq&quot;/&gt; According to the US [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahrq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buscemi |first1=N. |last2=Vandermeer |first2=B. |last3=Friesen |first3=C. |last4=Bialy |first4=L. |last5=Tubman |first5=M. |last6=Ospina |first6=M. |last7=Klassen |first7=T.

There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics/&gt;

Nonbenzodiazepines are a class of [[psychoactive drug]]s that are very &quot;benzodiazepine-like&quot; in nature. Nonbenzodiazepines [[pharmacodynamics]] are almost entirely the same as [[benzodiazepine]] drugs and therefore entail similar benefits, side-effects, and risks. Nonbenzodiazepines, however, have dissimilar or entirely different chemical structures, and therefore are unrelated to benzodiazepines on a molecular level.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9640488a&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siriwardena |first1=A.

Examples include [[zopiclone]] (Imovane, Zimovane), [[eszopiclone]] (Lunesta), [[zaleplon]] (Sonata), and [[zolpidem]] (Ambien, Stilnox, Stilnoct).

Research on nonbenzodiazepines is new and conflicting. A review by a team of researchers suggests the use of these drugs for people that have trouble falling asleep but not staying asleep,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Because the drugs have a shorter [[elimination half life]] they are metabolized more quickly: nonbenzodiazepines zaleplon and zolpidem have a half life of 1 and 2 hours (respectively); for comparison the benzodiazepine clonazepam has a half life of about 30 hours. This makes the drug suitable for sleep-onset difficulty, but the team noted sustained sleep efficacy was not clear.&lt;/ref&gt; as next-day impairments were minimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15746509&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benca |first=R.

===Others===

====Melatonin====
[[Melatonin]], the hormone produced in the pineal gland in the brain and secreted in dim light and darkness, among its other functions, promotes sleep in [[Diurnality|diurnal]] mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arendt|first1=J|last2=Skene|first2=DJ|title=Melatonin as a chronobiotic.|journal=Sleep Med Rev.|date=February 2005|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–39|pmid=15649736|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2004.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antihistamines====
{{Main article|H1 antagonist}}
In common use, the term ''antihistamine'' refers only to compounds that inhibit action at the H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (and not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.).

Clinically, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists are used to treat certain [[Allergy|allergies]]. Sedation is a common side-effect, and some H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists, such as [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl) and [[doxylamine]], are also used to treat insomnia.

[[Second-generation antihistamine]]s cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] to a much lower degree than the first ones.{{medical citation needed|date=February 2014}} This results in their primarily affecting peripheral histamine receptors, and therefore having a much lower sedative effect. High doses can still induce the [[central nervous system]] effect of drowsiness.

====Antidepressants====
Some [[antidepressant]]s have sedating effects. Some ''may'' increase actual quality of sleep (biologically) in contrast to  Benzodiazepines that decrease quality.

'''HMS ''Dunraven''''' was a [[Q-Ship]] of the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]].

On 8 August 1917, 130 miles southwest of [[Ushant]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], disguised as the collier ''Boverton'' and commanded by [[Gordon Campbell (Royal Navy officer)|Gordon Campbell, VC]], ''Dunraven'' spotted {{SMU|UC-71||2}}, commanded by ''Oberleutnant zur See'' [[Reinhold Saltzwedel]].  Saltzwedel believed the disguised ship was a merchant vessel.  The [[U-boat]] submerged and closed with ''Dunraven'' before surfacing astern at 11:43 am and opening fire at long range.  ''Dunraven'' made smoke and sent off a panic party (a small number of men who &quot;abandon ship&quot; during an attack to continue the impersonation of a merchant).

Shells began hitting ''Dunraven'', detonating her depth charges and setting her stern afire.  Her crew remained hidden letting the fires burn.  Then a 4&amp;nbsp;inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm) gun and crew were blown away revealing ''Dunraven''{{'}}s identity as a warship, and ''UC-71'' submerged.  A second &quot;panic party&quot; abandoned ship.  ''Dunraven'' was hit by a torpedo.  A third &quot;panic party&quot; went over the side, leaving only two guns manned.  ''UC-71'' surfaced, shelled ''Dunraven'' and again submerged.  Campbell replied with two torpedoes that missed, and around 3 pm, the undamaged U-boat left that area. Only one of ''Dunraven''{{'}}s crew was killed, but the Q-Ship was sinking.

The British [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Christopher}} picked up ''Dunraven''{{'}}s survivors and took her in tow for [[Plymouth]], but ''Dunraven'' sank at 1:30 am early on 10 August 1917 to the north of Ushant.

In recognition, two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded, one to the ship's First Lieutenant, Lt. [[Charles George Bonner]] RNR, and the other, by ballot, to a gunlayer, Petty Officer [[Ernest Herbert Pitcher]].

Captain Campbell later wrote:
:&quot;It had been a fair and honest fight, and I lost it.  Referring to my crew, words cannot express what I am feeling.  No one let me down. No one could have done better.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Captain Campbell had been previously awarded the Victoria Cross, in February 1917, for the sinking of {{SMU|U-83||2}}.

'''Hacker ethic''' is a term for the moral values and philosophy that are common in [[hacker culture]]. In other words, those who possess positive hacker ethic acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is very beneficial and helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html|title=hacker ethic|website=www.catb.org|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the philosophy originated at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the 1950s–1960s, the term ''hacker ethic'' is attributed to journalist [[Steven Levy]] as described in his 1984 book titled ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]].'' The key points within this ethic are access, freedom of information, and improvement to quality of life. While some tenets of hacker ethic were described in other texts like ''[[Computer Lib/Dream Machines]]'' (1974) by [[Ted Nelson]], Levy appears to have been the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy.

==History==
Levy explains that MIT housed an early [[IBM 704]] computer inside the Electronic Accounting Machinery (EAM) room in 1959. This room became the staging grounds for early hackers, as MIT students from the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] sneaked inside the EAM room after hours to attempt programming the 30-ton, {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} computer.

The MIT group defined a ''hack'' as a project undertaken or a product built to fulfill some constructive goal, but also with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|hack]]'' arose from MIT lingo, as the word had long been used to describe college pranks that MIT students would regularly devise.  However, Levy's hacker ethic also has often been quoted out of context and misunderstood to refer to [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking as in breaking into computers]], and so many sources incorrectly imply that it is describing the ideals of [[White hat (computer security)|white-hat hackers]]. However, what Levy is talking about does not necessarily have anything particular to do with computer security, but addresses broader issues.

The hacker ethic was described as a &quot;new way of life, with a philosophy, an ethic and a dream&quot;. However, the elements of the hacker ethic were not openly debated and discussed; rather they were implicitly accepted and silently agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free software movement]] was born in the early 1980s from followers of the hacker ethic.  Its founder, [[Richard Stallman]], is referred to by Steven Levy as &quot;the last true hacker&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See the title and content of the Epilogue to [[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern hackers who hold true to the hacker ethics—especially the Hands-On Imperative—are usually supporters of [[free and open source software]]. This is because free and open source software allows hackers to get access to the [[source code]] used to create the software, to allow it to be improved or reused in other projects.

Richard Stallman describes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong, to the ethical ideas this community of people had—that knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it, and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memex.org/meme2-04.html MEME 2.04] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and states more precisely that hacking (which Stallman defines as playful cleverness) and ethics are two separate issues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just because someone enjoys hacking does not mean he has an ethical commitment to treating other people properly. Some hackers care about ethics—I do, for instance—but that is not part of being a hacker, it is a separate trait. [...] Hacking is not primarily about an ethical issue. &lt;br /&gt;[...] hacking tends to lead a significant number of hackers to think about ethical questions in a certain way. I would not want to completely deny all connection between hacking and views on ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-hack.html The Hacker Community and Ethics: An Interview with Richard M. Stallman, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The hacker ethics==
As Levy summarized in the preface of ''Hackers'', the general tenets or principles of hacker ethic include:&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', page ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sharing
* Openness
* Decentralization
* Free access to computers
* World Improvement (foremost, upholding democracy and the fundamental laws we all live by, as a society)

In addition to those principles, Levy also described more specific hacker ethics and beliefs in chapter 2, ''The Hacker Ethic'':&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', pages 26–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics he described in chapter 2 are:

; Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!: Levy is recounting hackers' abilities to learn and build upon pre-existing ideas and systems. He believes that access gives hackers the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand how they work. This gives them the knowledge to create new and even more interesting things.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', pp 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Access aids the expansion of technology.
; [[Information wants to be free|All information should be free]]: Linking directly with the principle of access, information needs to be free for hackers to fix, improve, and reinvent systems. A free exchange of information allows for greater overall creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackerspg&quot;&gt;''Hackers''. pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; In the hacker viewpoint, any system could benefit from an easy flow of information,&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy, S 1984. pg 28&quot;&gt;''Hackers''. pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; a concept known as [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] in the social sciences. As [[Richard Stallman|Stallman]] notes, &quot;free&quot; refers to unrestricted access; it does not refer to price.&lt;ref name=&quot;denning&quot;&gt;http://faculty.nps.edu/dedennin/publications/ConcerningHackers-NCSC.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
; Mistrust authority—promote decentralization: The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an open system that presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that they need in their quest for knowledge, improvement, and time on-line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy, S 1984. pg 28&quot;/&gt; Hackers believe that [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], whether corporate, government, or university, are flawed systems.

Such a code within the hacker community fosters the advance of hacking and software development. In an example of the hacker ethic of equal opportunity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gabriellacoleman.org/biella/Coleman-Golub-Hacker-Practice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150305/http://gabriellacoleman.org/biella/Coleman-Golub-Hacker-Practice.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L Peter Deutsch]], a twelve-year-old hacker, was accepted in the [[TX-0]] community, though he was not recognized by non-hacker graduate students.

; Computers can change your life for the better: Hackers felt that computers had enriched their lives, given their lives focus, and made their lives adventurous. Hackers regarded computers as [[Aladdin's lamp]]s that they could control.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that everyone in society could benefit from experiencing such power and that if everyone could interact with computers in the way that hackers did, then the hacker ethic might spread through society and computers would improve the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 36&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers succeeded in turning dreams of endless possibilities into realities. The hacker's primary object was to teach society that &quot;the world opened up by the computer was a limitless one&quot; (Levy 230:1984)&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy 1984 pp 3&quot;/&gt;

===Sharing===
From the early days of modern computing through to the 1970s, it was far more common for computer users to have the freedoms that are provided by an ethic of open sharing and collaboration. Software, including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers. Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales, and provided or bundled the associated software free of charge. According to Levy's account, sharing was the norm and expected within the non-corporate hacker culture. The principle of sharing stemmed from the open atmosphere and informal access to resources at MIT. During the early days of computers and programming, the hackers at MIT would develop a program and share it with other computer users.

If the hack was deemed particularly good, then the program might be posted on a board somewhere near one of the computers. Other programs that could be built upon it and improved it were saved to tapes and added to a drawer of programs, readily accessible to all the other hackers. At any time, a fellow hacker might reach into the drawer, pick out the program, and begin adding to it or &quot;bumming&quot; it to make it better. Bumming referred to the process of making the code more concise so that more can be done in fewer instructions, saving precious memory for further enhancements.

In the second generation of hackers, sharing was about sharing with the general public in addition to sharing with other hackers. A particular organization of hackers that was concerned with sharing computers with the general public was a group called [[Community Memory]]. This group of hackers and idealists put computers in public places for anyone to use. The first community computer was placed outside of Leopold's Records in [[Berkeley, California]].

Another sharing of resources occurred when Bob Albrecht provided considerable resources for a non-profit organization called the [[People's Computer Company]] (PCC). PCC opened a computer center where anyone could use the computers there for fifty cents per hour.

This second generation practice of sharing contributed to the battles of free and open software. In fact, when [[Bill Gates]]' version of [[BASIC]] for the Altair was shared among the hacker community, Gates claimed to have lost a considerable sum of money because few users paid for the software. As a result, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = We-Think | author = Charles Leadbetter | publisher = Profile Books | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Metro | date = 12 March 2008 | author = Fiona Macdonald | title = Get a fair share of creativity }}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter was published by several computer magazines and newsletters, most notably that of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] where much of the sharing occurred.

===Hands-On Imperative===
Many of the principles and tenets of hacker ethic contribute to a common goal: the Hands-On Imperative. As Levy described in Chapter 2, &quot;Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems—about the world—from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and more interesting things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', pages 27–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing the Hands-On Imperative requires free access, open information, and the sharing of knowledge. To a true hacker, if the Hands-On Imperative is restricted, then the ends justify the means to make it unrestricted ''so that improvements can be made''. When these principles are not present, hackers tend to work around them. For example, when the computers at MIT were protected either by physical locks or login programs, the hackers there systematically worked around them in order to have access to the machines. Hackers assumed a &quot;willful blindness&quot; in the pursuit of perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackerspg&quot; /&gt;

This behavior was not malicious in nature: the MIT hackers did not seek to harm the systems or their users. This deeply contrasts with the modern, media-encouraged image of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who crack secure systems in order to steal information or complete an act of cyber-vandalism.

===Community and collaboration===
Throughout writings about hackers and their work processes, a common value of community and collaboration is present. For example, in Levy's ''Hackers'', each generation of hackers had geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing occurred. For the hackers at MIT, it was the labs where the computers were running. For the hardware hackers (second generation) and the game hackers (third generation) the geographic area was centered in [[Silicon Valley]] where the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and the [[People's Computer Company]] helped hackers network, collaborate, and share their work.

The concept of community and collaboration is still relevant today, although hackers are no longer limited to collaboration in geographic regions. Now collaboration takes place via the Internet. [[Eric S. Raymond]] identifies and explains this conceptual shift in ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html |title=The Social Context of Open-Source Software |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before cheap Internet, there were some geographically compact communities where the culture encouraged Weinberg's egoless programming, and a developer could easily attract a lot of skilled kibitzers and co-developers. Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC Berkeley: these became the home of innovations that are legendary and still potent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Raymond also notes that the success of Linux coincided with the wide availability of the [[World Wide Web]]. The value of community is still in high practice and use today.

==Levy's &quot;true hackers&quot;==
{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Levy identifies several &quot;true hackers&quot; who significantly influenced the hacker ethic. Some well-known &quot;true hackers&quot; include:

* [[Bill Gosper]]: Mathematician and hacker
* [[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]]: Programmer and early designer of [[Lisp machine|LISP machines]]
* [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]: Co-founder of the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab]] and [[Stanford AI Laboratory]]
* [[Jude Milhon]]: Founder of the [[cypherpunk]] movement, senior editor at ''[[Mondo 2000]]'', and co-founder of [[Community Memory]]
* [[Richard Stallman]]: Programmer and political activist who is well known for [[GNU]], [[Emacs]] and the [[Free Software Movement]]

Levy also identified the &quot;hardware hackers&quot; (the &quot;second generation&quot;, mostly centered in [[Silicon Valley]]) and the &quot;game hackers&quot; (or the &quot;third generation&quot;). All three generations of hackers, according to Levy, embodied the principles of the hacker ethic. Some of Levy's &quot;second-generation&quot; hackers include:

* [[Steve Dompier]]: Homebrew Computer Club member and hacker who worked with the early [[Altair 8800]]
* [[John Draper]]: A legendary figure in the computer programming world. He wrote [[EasyWriter]], the first word processor.
* [[Lee Felsenstein]]: A hardware hacker and co-founder of [[Community Memory]] and Homebrew Computer Club; a designer of the [[Sol-20]] computer
* [[Bob Marsh]]: A designer of the [[Sol-20]] computer
* [[Fred Moore (activist)|Fred Moore]]: Activist and founder of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]
* [[Steve Wozniak]]: One of the founders of [[Apple Computer]]

Levy's &quot;third generation&quot; practitioners of hacker ethic include:

* John Harris: One of the first programmers hired at On-Line Systems (which later became [[Sierra Entertainment]])
* [[Ken Williams (gaming)|Ken Williams]]: Along with wife [[Roberta Williams|Roberta]], founded On-Line Systems after working at IBM – the company would later achieve mainstream popularity as [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]

== Teaching Ethical Hacking ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

In this digital age, and due to our reliance on technology, hackers are able to gather more information on us than before. One way to combat this is to teach students to hack in such a way that they become what are called ''white hat hackers''. White hat hackers follow ethical guidelines that proscribe harming either other people or the systems on which other people depend. Through their efforts, they have the ability to prevent malicious attacks. The movement of ethical hacking has gained traction through different programs such as the [[L0pht]] and GhettoHackers, and courses have become integrated into university- and college-level curriculum.

===Discourage Black Hat Hacking===

Security researcher and an application security engineer Joe Gervais pointed out that students who are intellectually curious enough may start to experiment with computers without thinking of the ethical repercussions of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/hacker-high-why-we-need-to-teach-hacking-in-schools/|title= Hacker High: Why We Need To Teach Hacking in Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date= 2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that there are a lot of classes that exist for more gifted students in areas such as math, reading, etc. However, there doesn’t seem to be courses that can address the curiosity that a young hacker may have.

Hacking courses can create a moral compass for young hackers. They require a constructive environment that allows them to satiate their desire to understand computers. Students in these classes have the ability to learn what they are passionate about while also understanding the ethical boundaries that should not be encroached upon. However, the integral part of the curriculum would be to prevent the development of black hat hackers.

===Encourage White Hat Hacking===

There seems to be a lack of skilled cyber security experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/09/30/cybersecurity-defense-hampered-by-lack-of-white-hat-hacker-talent/|title= Cybersecurity Defense Hampered by Lack of ‘White Hat’ Hacker Talent| last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date= 2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there doesn’t seem to be curriculums that teaches individuals the skills required to protect security systems from malicious attacks. Teaching hacking is a plausible way to fill the gap in the supply and the demand of hackers who are capable of implementing defensive measures against attacks. Ymir Vigfusson, professor at the School of Computer Science at Reykjavik University and assistant professor in Emory University’s Math and Science Department, is a major advocate for educating students about hacking. Ymir points out that teaching hacking can be a way for students to better understand the computer security. He believes that hackers have a unique mindset where they are constantly thinking about how they can get through cyber security. However, defenders, or the ones providing the cyber security are only thinking of ways to keep people out. Defenders are concerned with thinking about how to keep people out. However, what ethical hackers can contribute is how to break in. This mindset allows defenders to realize weak points in security systems and to reinforce those shortfalls. In 2012, Ymir held a TedTalk in Rekjavijk titled &quot;Why I Teach People to Hack&quot; that further illustrates reasons supporting the teaching of hacking.

==Other descriptions==
In 2001, [[Finland|Finnish]] philosopher [[Pekka Himanen]] promoted the hacker ethic in opposition to the [[Protestant work ethic]]. In Himanen's opinion, the hacker ethic is more closely related to the [[virtue ethics]] found in the writings of [[Plato]] and of [[Aristotle]]. Himanen explained these ideas in a book, ''[[The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age]]'', with a prologue contributed by [[Linus Torvalds]] and an epilogue by [[Manuel Castells]].

In this manifesto, the authors wrote about a hacker ethic centering on passion, hard work, creativity and joy in creating software. Both Himanen and Torvalds were inspired by the [[Sampo]] in [[Finnish mythology]]. The Sampo, described in the [[Kalevala]] saga, was a magical artifact constructed by [[Ilmarinen]], the blacksmith god, that brought good fortune to its holder; nobody knows exactly what it was supposed to be. The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a [[Axis mundi|world pillar]] or [[world tree]], a [[compass]] or [[astrolabe]], a chest containing a treasure, a [[Byzantine]] [[coin die]], a decorated [[Vendel]] period shield, a Christian relic, etc. Kalevala saga compiler Lönnrot interpreted it to be a &quot;[[Quern-stone|quern]]&quot; or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of thin air.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The hacker ethic and its wider context can be associated with [[liberalism]] and [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=E.

[[File:Mercure hotel taksim.jpg|thumb|A typical hotel room with a bed, desk and television|350x350px]]A '''hotel''' is an establishment that provides paid [[lodging]] on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and [[En-suite|en-suite bathroom]]s. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually [[Room number|numbered]] (or named in some smaller hotels and [[Bed and breakfast|B&amp;Bs]]) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, [[capsule hotel]]s provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.
[[File:The Peninsula Paris.jpg|thumb|[[The Peninsula Paris]] hotel|320x320px]]The precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]]. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travelers. Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in [[Exeter]] in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.

Hotel operations vary in size, function, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility offers [[Luxury goods|luxury]] amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site [[restaurant]], and the highest level of personalized service, such as a [[concierge]], [[room service]] and clothes pressing staff. [[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large number of full service accommodations, an on-site full service [[restaurant]], and a variety of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. [[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. [[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.

[[Timeshare]] and [[destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A [[motel]] is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. [[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]]. Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for example at [[casino]]s and holiday [[resort]]s.

Most hotel establishments are run by a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the &quot;[[Hotel Manager]]&quot;), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

==Etymology==
The word ''hotel'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''hôtel'' (coming from the same origin as ''[[hospital]]''), which referred to a French version of a building seeing frequent visitors, and providing care, rather than a place offering accommodation. In contemporary French usage, ''hôtel'' now has the same meaning as the English term, and ''[[hôtel particulier]]'' is used for the old meaning, as well as &quot;hôtel&quot; in some place names such as [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]] (in Paris), which has been a hospital since the [[Middle Ages]]. The French spelling, with the [[circumflex]], was also used in English, but is now rare. The circumflex replaces the 's' found in the earlier ''[[hostel]]'' spelling, which over time took on a new, but closely related meaning. Grammatically, hotels usually take the [[definite article]] – hence &quot;The Astoria Hotel&quot; or simply &quot;The Astoria.&quot;

==History==
[[File:Tabard inn mid19th.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Tabard Inn, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark, London]]]]
Facilities offering hospitality to travellers have been a feature of the earliest civilizations. In [[Greco-Roman culture]] hospitals for recuperation and rest were built at [[thermal bath]]s. During the [[Middle Ages]] various religious orders at [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s would offer accommodation for travellers on the road.

The precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]], possibly dating back to the rule of [[Ancient Rome]]. These would provide for the needs of travelers, including food and lodging, [[Stable|stabling]] and [[fodder]] for the traveler's horse(s) and fresh horses for the [[mail coach]]. Famous London examples of inns include the [[The George, Southwark|George]] and the [[The Tabard|Tabard]]. A typical layout of an inn had an inner court with bedrooms on the two sides, with the [[kitchen]] and [[parlour]] at the front and the stables at the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4017990.html|title=Hotels: A Brief History |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travelers (in other words, a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]). Coaching [[inn]]s stabled teams of [[horse]]s for [[stagecoach]]es and [[mail coach]]es and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart but this depended very much on the terrain.

[[File:TremontHouse ca1830s byJamesBennett Boston SimonsUPNE.png|thumb|left|[[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] in [[Boston]], United States, a luxury hotel, the first to provide indoor plumbing]]
Some [[England|English]] towns had as many as ten such [[inn]]s and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.&lt;ref&gt;Coaching Era, The: ''Stage and Mail Coach Travel in and Around Bath, Bristol and Somerset'', Roy Gallop, Fiducia  (2003), {{ISBN|1-85026-019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inns began to cater for richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and the level of service provided. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was [[Royal Clarence Hotel|opened]] in [[Exeter]] in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early 19th century. In 1812 [[Claridge's|Mivart's Hotel]] opened its doors in [[London]], later changing its name to Claridge's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/buildings/inns.shtml|title=Researching the history of pubs, inns and hotels|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century, and luxury hotels, including the [[Savoy Hotel]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[César Ritz|Ritz chain of hotels]] in [[London]] and [[Paris]] and [[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] and [[Astor House]] in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles25/hotels-12.shtml |title=Nineteenth Century Hotels In The United States|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to spring up in the later part of the century, catering to an extremely wealthy clientele.

==International scale==
Hotels cater to travelers from many countries and languages, since no one country dominates the travel industry.

==Types==
Hotel operations vary in size, function, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies that operate hotels have set widely accepted industry standards to classify hotel types. General categories include the following:

==={{anchor|Luxury}}Luxury===
A luxury hotel offers high quality amenities, full service accommodations, on-site full-service restaurants, and the highest level of personalized and professional service. Luxury hotels are normally classified with at least a Four Diamond or [[AAA Five Diamond Award|Five Diamond]] rating by American Automobile Association or a Four or [[Star (classification)|Five Star]] [[hotel rating]] depending on the country and local classification standards. ''Examples include: [[InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts|InterContinental]], [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]], [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]], and [[The Ritz-Carlton]].''

==={{anchor|Boutique}}Boutique and lifestyle hotels===
[[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities of varying size in unique or intimate settings with full service accommodations. These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hvs.com/Content/3171.pdf|title = Boutique Hotels Segment|last = Balekjian|first = Cristina|date = September 2011|journal = HVS|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifestyle hotels are branded properties that appeal to a guest with specific lifestyle or personal image. They are typically full-service and sometimes classified as luxury. A key characteristic of boutique and lifestyle hotels is their focus on providing a unique guest experience as opposed to simply providing lodging. Examples include [[W Hotels]], [[Andaz (hotel)|Andaz]] and [[Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurants|Kimpton Hotels]].

==={{anchor|Full}}Full-service===
[[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center. Full-service hotels range in quality from mid-scale to luxury.  This classification is based upon the quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Full-Service Vs. Limited-Service Hotels|url = http://traveltips.usatoday.com/fullservice-vs-limitedservice-hotels-106136.html|website = Travel Tips - USA Today|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include: [[Holiday Inn]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]], and [[Hyatt Regency]] brands.

==={{anchor|Focused}}Focused or select service===
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited number of on-site amenities that only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the single business traveler. Most focused or select service hotels may still offer full service accommodations but may lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. Examples include [[Hyatt Place]], [[Courtyard by Marriott]] and [[Hilton Garden Inn]].

==={{anchor|Economy}}Economy and limited service===
Small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a very limited amount of on-site amenities and often only offer basic accommodations with little to no services, these facilities normally only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the budget-minded traveler seeking a &quot;no frills&quot; accommodation. Limited service hotels often lack an on-site restaurant but in return may offer a limited complimentary food and beverage amenity such as on-site continental breakfast service. Examples include [[Ibis Budget]], [[Hampton Inn]], [[Aloft Hotels|Aloft]], [[Holiday Inn Express]], [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn]], [[Four Points by Sheraton]], and [[Days Inn]].

==={{anchor|Extended}}Extended stay===
[[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. Extended stay hotels may offer non-traditional pricing methods such as a weekly rate that caters towards travelers in need of short-term accommodations for an extended period of time. Similar to limited and select service hotels, on-site amenities are normally limited and most extended stay hotels lack an on-site restaurant. Examples include [[Staybridge Suites]], [[Candlewood Suites]], [[Homewood Suites by Hilton]], [[Home2 Suites by Hilton]], [[Residence Inn by Marriott]], [[Element by Westin|Element]], and [[Extended Stay America]].

==={{anchor|Timeshare}}Timeshare and destination clubs===
[[Timeshare]] and [[Destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership also referred to as a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a Full service hotel with on-site restaurant(s), swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include [[Hilton Grand Vacations]], [[Marriott Vacation Club International]], [[Westgate Resorts]], [[Disney Vacation Club]], and [[Holiday Inn|Holiday Inn Club Vacations]].

==={{anchor|Motel}}Motel===
A [[motel]], an abbreviation for &quot;motor hotel&quot;, is a small-sized low-rise lodging establishment similar to a limited service, lower-cost hotel, but typically with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Motels were built to serve road travellers, including travellers on road trip vacations and workers who drive for their job (travelling salespeople, truck drivers, etc.). Common during the 1950s and 1960s, motels were often located adjacent to a major highway, where they were built on inexpensive land at the edge of towns or along stretches of freeway.

New motel construction is rare in the 2000s as hotel chains have been building economy-priced, limited service franchised properties at freeway exits which compete for largely the same clientele, largely saturating the market by the 1990s. Motels are still useful in less populated areas for driving travelers, but the more populated an area becomes, the more hotels move in to meet the demand for accommodation. Many of the motels which remain in operation have joined national franchise chains, often rebranding themselves as hotels, inns or lodges.

==={{anchor|Microstay}}Microstay===
Hotels may offer rooms for [[microstays]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=By-the-Hour Microstays Add to Big Hotels’ Bottom Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/a-room-by-the-hour-to-refresh.html|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a type of booking for less than 24 hours where the customer chooses the check in time and the length of the stay. This allows the hotel increased revenue by reselling the same room several times a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoteliers urged to tap into microstays market to stay ahead|url=http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Business/Hoteliers-urged-to-tap-into-micro-stay-market-to-stay-ahead|website=www.bighospitality.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
{{Main article|Hotel management}}
Hotel management is a globally accepted professional career field and academic field of study. Degree programs such as [[hospitality management studies]], a [[business degree]], and/or certification programs formally prepare hotel managers for industry practice.

Most hotel establishments consist of a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the &quot;Hotel Manager&quot;), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel, [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

=={{anchor|Unique}}Unique and specialty hotels==

=== {{anchor|Historic}} Historic inns and boutique hotels ===
[[File:Hotel Astoria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]] and statue of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia]]
[[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.
Some hotels have gained their renown through tradition, by hosting significant events or persons, such as Schloss [[Cecilienhof]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], which derives its fame from the [[Potsdam Conference]] of the [[World War II]] allies [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Schloss Cecilienhof - Cecilienhof Palace|url = http://www.potsdam.de/node/276259|website = Landeshauptstadt Potsdam|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower]] in [[Mumbai]] is one of India's most famous and historic hotels because of its association with the [[Indian independence movement]]. Some establishments have given name to a particular meal or beverage, as is the case with the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]] in [[New York City]], United States where the [[Waldorf Salad]] was first created or the [[Hotel Sacher]] in [[Vienna]], Austria, home of the [[Sachertorte]]. Others have achieved fame by association with dishes or cocktails created on their premises, such as the [[Hotel de Paris]] where the [[crêpe Suzette]] was invented or the [[Raffles Hotel]] in [[Singapore]], where the [[Singapore Sling]] cocktail was devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Campbell | title=Singapore Journal; Back to Somerset Maugham and Life's Seamy Side |

[[File:Hotel Ritz Paris.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] in [[France]]]]

A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]], through its association with [[Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin's]] song, '[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]'. The [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York City is famed as the meeting place of the literary group, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], and [[Hotel Chelsea]], also in New York City, has been the subject of a number of songs and the scene of the stabbing of [[Nancy Spungen]] (allegedly by her boyfriend [[Sid Vicious]]).

==={{anchor|Resort}}Resort hotels===
[[File:Wynn 2 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Wynn Las Vegas]], United States]]
Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade, example at [[casino]]s, [[amusement park]]s and holiday [[resort]]s. Though of course hotels have always been built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a resort hotel is that it exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.

On the [[Las Vegas Strip]] there is a tradition of [[one-upmanship]] with luxurious and extravagant hotels in a concentrated area. This trend now has extended to other resorts worldwide, but the concentration in Las Vegas is still the world's highest: nineteen of the world's twenty-five largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/largesthotels.htm |title=The 25 Largest Hotels in the World|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe [[Center Parcs]] might be considered a chain of resort hotels, since the sites are largely man-made (though set in natural surroundings such as [[country park]]s) with captive trade, whereas [[holiday camp]]s such as [[Butlins]] and [[Pontin's]] are probably not considered as resort hotels, since they are set at traditional holiday destinations which existed before the camps.

He attended Sayre Elementary School and [[Steinmetz College Prep|Steinmetz High School]], then served from 1944 to 1946 as a [[U.S. Army]] writer for a military newspaper. Hefner graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] in 1949 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] and a double [[Minor (academic)|minor]] in [[Creative Writing]] and [[Art]], having earned his degree in two and a half years. After graduation, he took a semester of graduate courses in [[Sociology]] at [[Northwestern University]], but dropped out soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playboyenterprises.com/home/content.cfm?content=t_template&amp;packet=00061D22-C172-1C7A-9B578304E50A011A&amp;MmenuFlag=profile Hugh M.

==Career==

In January 1952, Hefner left his job as a [[copywriter]] for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' after he was denied a $5 raise. In 1953, he took out a mortgage, generating a bank loan of $600, and raised $8,000 from 45 investors, including $1,000 from his mother (&quot;Not because she believed in the venture,&quot; he told ''[[E!]]'' in 2006, &quot;but because she believed in her son.&quot;), to launch ''[[Playboy]]'', which was initially going to be called ''Stag Party''. The first issue, published in December 1953, featured [[Marilyn Monroe]] from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/famousentrepreneurs/p/hughhefner.htm Hugh Hefner: The Ultimate Lifestyle Entrepreneur]. Entrepreneurs.about.com. Retrieved on May 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hefner, who never met Monroe, bought the [[crypt]] next to hers at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in 1992 for $75,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_20110203&quot;&gt;,{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/magazine/06Hefner-t.html | title = How Hef Got His Groove Back | date = February 3, 2011 | author = Charles McGrath | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Buried2/PierceBros5.shtml Westwood Village Memorial Cemetery]. Seeing-Stars.com.&lt;/ref&gt;)

After the [[Charles Beaumont]] [[science fiction]] short story &quot;The Crooked Man&quot; was rejected by ''Esquire'' magazine in 1955, Hefner agreed to publish the story in ''Playboy.'' The story highlighted straight men being persecuted in a world where homosexuality was the norm. After the magazine received angry letters, Hefner wrote a response to criticism where he said, &quot;If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse was wrong, too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2009/08/28/hugh-hefner-gay-rights-pioneer &quot;Hugh Hefner, Gay Rights Pioneer&quot;], advocate.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Hefner watched [[Dick Gregory]] perform at the Herman Roberts Show Bar in Chicago. Based on that performance, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago Playboy Club; Gregory attributed the subsequent launch of his career to that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/page/ct-perspec-page-dick-gregory-civil-rights-0823-story.html|title=Column: Dick Gregory understood the political power of comedy|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=August 22, 2017|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1963, Hefner was arrested for promoting obscene literature after he published an issue of ''Playboy'' that featured nude shots of [[Jayne Mansfield]] in bed with a man present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pitzulo | first = Carrie | title = Bachelors and Bunnies: The Sexual Politics of Playboy | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2011 | page = 66 | isbn = 978-0-226-67006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case went to trial and resulted in a [[hung jury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Hugh-Hefner-9333521?part=1 Hugh Hefner Biography]. biography.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968)|civil rights era]] in 1966, Hefner sent [[Alex Haley]] to interview [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], much to Rockwell's surprise because Haley was black. Rockwell had founded the [[American Nazi Party]] and would be later described by some as the &quot;American Hitler&quot;. Rockwell agreed to meet with Haley only after gaining assurance from the Playboy writer that he was not Jewish, although Rockwell kept a handgun on the table throughout the interview. The interview was recreated in ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'' in 1979, with [[James Earl Jones]] as Haley and [[Marlon Brando]] as Rockwell; Brando won a Primetime Emmy Award for his portrayal of Rockwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Sequel to ‘Roots': Inevitable Question|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/15/archives/tv-sequel-to-roots-inevitable-question-new-oral-memoir.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haley had also interviewed [[Malcolm X]] in 1963 and [[MLK|Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1966 for the newly established 1962 &quot;playboy interview&quot;; all three interviewees would be assassinated by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Icon and Playboy Founder, Hugh M.

He called the admission &quot;the most devastating moment of my life.&quot; A 2006 ''[[E!

Hefner remade himself as a [[bon vivant]] and man about town, a lifestyle he promoted in his magazine and two TV shows he hosted, ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'' (1959–1960) and ''[[Playboy After Dark]]'' (1969–1970). He admitted to being &quot;'involved' with maybe eleven out of twelve months' worth of Playmates&quot; during some of these years.&lt;ref&gt;Acocella, Joan [https://web.archive.org/web/20100811192831/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/20/060320crbo_books &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot;], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', March 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Michelle]], [[Marilyn Cole]], [[Lillian Müller]], [[Shannon Tweed]], [[Barbi Benton]], [[Karen Christy]], [[Sondra Theodore]], and Carrie Leigh&amp;nbsp;– who filed a $35 million [[palimony]] suit against him&amp;nbsp;– were a few of his many lovers.

In 1985, Hefner had a minor stroke at age 59. After re-evaluating his lifestyle, he made several changes. The wild, all-night parties were toned down significantly and in 1988, daughter Christie took over the operation of the Playboy empire. The following year, he married Playmate of the Year [[Kimberley Conrad]]; they were 36 years apart in age. The couple had two sons: Marston Glenn (born 1990) and Cooper Bradford (born 1991).&lt;ref name=TV&gt;[http://www.tv.com/cooper-hefner/person/545473/summary.html Cooper Hefner].

Hefner became known for moving an ever-changing coterie of young women into the Playboy Mansion, including twins [[Sandy Bentley|Sandy and Mandy Bentley]]. He dated as many as seven women concurrently. He also dated [[Brande Roderick]], [[Izabella St. James]], [[Tina Marie Jordan]], [[Holly Madison]], [[Bridget Marquardt]], and [[Kendra Wilkinson]].

In January 2016, the Playboy Mansion was put on the market for $200 million, on condition that Hugh Hefner would continue to work and live in the mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/playboy-mansion-for-sale-but-hugh-hefner-wants-to-stay-put/2016/01/11/ef0ab744-b8c4-11e5-85cd-5ad59bc19432_story.html|title=Washington Post: Playboy Mansion for sale but Hugh Hefner wants to stay put|access-date=January 16, 2016 | date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year it was sold to Daren Metropoulos, a principal at private equity firm Metropoulos &amp; Company, for $100 million. Metropoulos planned to reconnect the Playboy Mansion property with a neighboring estate that he purchased in 2009, combining the two for a 7.3 acre (3-hectare) compound as his own private residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion sells for $100 million|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-playboy-mansion-idUSKCN10R2FT|website=Reuters|access-date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2017, [[Eugena Washington]] was the last Playmate of the Year to be announced by [[Hugh Hefner]] at the [[Playboy Mansion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TMZ&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tmz.com/2017/09/29/hugh-hefner-back-infection-declining-health/|title=Hugh Hefner Crippling Back Infection Started Decline in Health |date=September 29, 2017 |publisher=[[TMZ]] |accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and philanthropy==
The [[Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award]] was created by Christie Hefner &quot;to honor individuals who have made significant contributions in the vital effort to protect and enhance First Amendment rights for Americans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Playboy Enterprises, Inc., &quot;[http://www.playboyenterprises.com/home/content.cfm?content=t_title_as_division&amp;ArtTypeID=0008B752-BBD0-1C76-8FEA8304E50A010D&amp;packet=0001F2B3-75D2-1C7A-9B578304E50A011A&amp;MmenuFlag=foundation&amp;viewMe=1 Playboy Foundation – Hugh M.

He donated and raised money for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Hugh_Hefner.php Hugh Hefner's Federal Campaign Contribution Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231082551/http://newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Hugh_Hefner.php |date=December 31, 2009 }}.

We're celebrating at the Mansion. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Hefner helped organize fund-raising efforts that led to the restoration of the [[Hollywood Sign]]. He hosted a gala fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion and contributed $27,000 (or 1/9 of the total restoration costs) by purchasing the letter Y in a ceremonial auction.&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article7109871.ece |title=Hugh Hefner saves iconic Hollywood sign |publisher=[[Times Online]] |date=April 27, 2010 |access-date=December 26, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/history-10.html |title=The History of the Sign: 1978: A Sign is Reborn |publisher=Hollywood Sign |access-date=December 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125131602/http://www.hollywoodsign.org/history-10.html |archivedate=November 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner donated $100,000 to the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]] to create a course called &quot;Censorship in Cinema&quot;, and $2&amp;nbsp;million to endow a chair for the study of American film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-11-15-hefner-USC_N.htm Hefner Gives $2M to USC Film School] [[Associated Press]], November 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both through his charitable foundation and individually, Hefner also contributed to charities outside the sphere of politics and publishing, throwing fundraiser events for Much Love Animal Rescue as well as [[Generation Rescue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://celebrityhalo.blogspot.com/2008/10/hugh-hefner-jenny-mccarthy-fund-autism.html | title = Hugh Hefner &amp; Jenny McCarthy Fund Autism Research | work = Celebrity Halo |date=October 2008 | access-date =December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial [[anti-vaccinationist]] campaign organization supported by [[Jenny McCarthy]].

On November 18, 2010, Children of the Night founder and president Dr. Lois Lee presented Hefner with the organization's first-ever Founder's Hero of the Heart Award in appreciation for his unwavering dedication, commitment and generosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2010 founder's hero of the heart Award|date=November 18, 2010|url=http://www.childrenofthenight.org/pdf/Hugh_Hefner_Founders_Hero_of_the_Heart_Award.pdf|access-date=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2010, Hefner donated the last $900,000 sought by a conservation group for a land purchase needed to stop the development of the famed vista of the [[Hollywood Sign]].&lt;ref name=hollywood /&gt; ''[[Sylvilagus palustris hefneri]]'', an endangered subspecies of [[marsh rabbit]], is named after him in honor of financial support that he provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My True Love Gave To Me ...

Hefner supported legalizing [[same-sex marriage]], and he stated that a fight for [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|gay marriage]] was &quot;a fight for all our rights. Without it, we will turn back the sexual revolution and return to an earlier, puritanical time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playboy founder Hugh Hefner writes passionate plea in support of gay marriage|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/playboy-founder-hugh-hefner-writes-passionate-plea-support-gay-marriage-article-1.1142988|access-date=August 23, 2012|newspaper=[[NYDailyNews.com]]|date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

He is interred at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles, in the $75,000 crypt beside [[Marilyn Monroe]]. &quot;Spending eternity next to Marilyn is an opportunity too sweet to pass up,&quot; Hefner had told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-playboy-founder-hugh-hefner-dies-20170927-story.html|title=Hugh Hefner, Playboy founder who built his empire in Chicago, dies at age 91|first=Rick|last=Kogan|website=chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', journalist [[Suzanne Moore]] wrote that Hefner threatened to file a lawsuit against her for calling him a &quot;[[pimp]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2017&quot;/&gt; Defending her position, Moore argued that &quot;he was a man who bought and sold women to other men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2017&quot;/&gt; She further stated that &quot;Part of Hefner's business acumen was to make the selling of female flesh respectable and hip, to make soft porn acceptable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/28/hugh-hefner-pimp-sue-playboy-mansion|title=I called Hugh Hefner a pimp, he threatened to sue. But that’s what he was|date=28 September 2017|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|language=English|accessdate=29 September 2017|author=[[Suzanne Moore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', in the same vein, English writer [[Julie Bindel]] stated that Hefner &quot;caused immeasurable damage by turning porn – and therefore the buying and selling of women’s bodies – into a legitimate business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hugh-hefner-dead-death-playboy-mansion-bunny-women-misogynist-predatory-enemy-a7972046.html|title=Hugh Hefner was the ultimate enemy of women – no feminist anywhere will shed a tear at his death|date=28 September 2017|publisher=[[The Independent]]|language=English|accessdate=29 September 2017|author=[[Julie Bindel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing for ''[[Christianity Today]]'', [[Missiology|Missiologist]] [[Ed Stetzer]] wrote that during his lifetime, when [[Christie Hefner]] visited the Playboy Mansion, he would have the residence systematically cleaned in order &quot;to keep the realities from his own daughter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stetzer2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2017/september/hugh-hefner-mourning-and-legacies.html|title=Hugh Hefner, Mourning, and Legacies: Beyond the Pipe and the Robe|date=28 September 2017|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|language=English|accessdate=29 September 2017|author=[[Ed Stetzer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stezer further lamented the consequences of Hefner's role as a &quot;general&quot; of the [[sexual revolution]]:
{{quotation|It’s hard to fathom that anyone would have known what this would have turned into. Parents growing up today are fighting to keep their children pure. Spouses are fighting to keep their marriages intact. And many enslaved and trapped in the adult entertainment industry have been figuratively and literally stripped not only of their clothes, but their very value as people made in the image of God. If this does not concern us, what will?&lt;ref name=&quot;Stetzer2017&quot;/&gt;}}

Hefner's former girlfriend, [[Holly Madison]], said that while she lived in the Playboy Mansion, Hefner &quot;would encourage competition—and body image issues—between his multiple live-in girlfriends. His legacy is full of evidence of the exploitation of women for professional gain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/opinions/hugh-hefner-legacy-has-a-dark-side-drexler/index.html|title=Hugh Hefner's legacy has a dark side|last=Drexler|first=Peggy|date=29 September 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|language=English|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
On October 3, 2017, it was announced that [[Academy Award]] winner actor [[Jared Leto]] would play Hugh Hefner in a [[biopic]] directed by [[Brett Ratner]] with the screenplay by [[Jeff Nathanson]] but the biopic was put indefinitely on hold and was confirmed that Leto would not portray the ''[[Playboy]]'' founder following an emergence of sexual harassment allegations against Ratner on November 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41485999|title=Jared Leto to star in Hugh Hefner biopic|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/brett-ratner-hugh-hefner-biopic-delayed/|title= Brett Ratner’s Hugh Hefner Biopic is Dead in the Water |publisher=Screen rant|date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hafizullah Amin''' ([[Pashto]]/{{lang-prs|حفيظ الله امين}}; born 1 August 1929 – 27 December 1979) was an Afghan [[politician]] during the [[Cold War]]. Amin was born in [[Paghman]] and educated at [[Kabul University]], after which he started his career as a teacher. After a few years in that occupation, he went to the United States to study. He would visit the United States a second time before moving permanently to Afghanistan, and starting his career in radical politics. He ran as a candidate in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1965|1965 parliamentary election]] but failed to secure a seat. Amin was the only [[Khalq]]ist elected to parliament in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]], thus increasing his standing within the party. He was one of the leading organisers of the [[Saur Revolution]] which overthrew the government of [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]].

Amin's short-lived presidency was marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering the death of his predecessor [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The [[Soviet Union]], which alleged that Amin was an agent of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|intervened in Afghanistan]] while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of [[Operation Storm-333]], having ruled for slightly longer than three months.

==Early life and career==
Hafizullah Amin was born to a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] family in [[Paghman]]{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA80 80]}} on 1 August 1929.{{sfn|Jessup|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hP7jJAkTd9MC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}} His father, a civil servant, died when he was still very young. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]], which in turn allowed him to attend [[Kabul University]] (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the [[Darul Mualimeen Teachers College]] in Kabul, and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious [[Avesina High School]], and in 1957 left Afghanistan for [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], where he earned [[Master of Arts|M. A.]] in education.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA80 80]}} It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to [[Marxism]], and in 1958 he became a member of the university's [[Socialist Progressive Club]].{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zvm9dxavH-IC&amp;pg=PA110 110]}} When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at Kabul University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA80 80–81]}} During this period Amin became acquainted with [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], a [[communism|communist]]. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School in order to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}}

It is alleged that Amin became radicalised during his second stay in the United States in 1962, when he enrolled in a work-study group at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the [[Columbia University Teachers College]], but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head of the Afghan students' association at the college. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend [[Ali Ahmad Popel]], a previous Afghan [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Education]]. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}} Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather [[West Germany]] and [[Lebanon]].{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zvm9dxavH-IC&amp;pg=PA110 110]}} By the time he had returned to Afghanistan, the Communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran as a candidate for the PDPA in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1965|1965 parliamentary election]], and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}}

In 1966, when the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]] was expanded, Amin was elected as a non-voting member, and in the spring of 1967 he gained full membership. Amin's standing in the [[Khalq]] faction of the PDPA increased when he was the only Khalqist elected to parliament in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]].{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}} When the PDPA split along factional lines in 1967, between Khalqists led by Nur and [[Parcham]]ites led by [[Babrak Karmal]], Amin joined the Khalqists. As a member of parliament, Amin tried to win over support from the Pashtun people in the armed forces.{{sfn|Saikal|Farhadi|Nourzhanov|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuF55mSIt4EC&amp;pg=PA163 163]}} According to a biography about Amin, he used his position as member of parliament to fight against [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], and [[Reactionary|reactionary tendencies]], and fought against the &quot;rotten&quot; regime, the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|monarchy]]. Amin himself said that he used his membership in parliament to pursue the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]].{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA48 48]}} Relations between Khalqists and Parchamites deteriorated during this period. Amin, the only Khalq member of parliament, and [[Babrak Karmal]], the only Parcham member of parliament, did not cooperate with each other. Amin would later, during his short stint in power, mention these events with bitterness.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA49 49]}} Following the arrest of fellow PDPA members [[Dastagir Panjsheri]] and [[Saleh Mohammad Zeary]] in 1969, Amin became one of the party's leading members,{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA53 53]}} and was still a pre-eminent party member by the time of their release in 1973.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA53 53–54]}}

===The Daoud era===
From 1973 until the PDPA unification in 1977, Amin was second only to Taraki in the Khalqist PDPA. When the PDPA ruled Afghanistan, their relationship was referred to as a disciple (Amin) following his mentor (Taraki). This official portrayal of the situation was misleading; their relationship was more work-oriented. Taraki needed Amin's &quot;tactical and strategic talents&quot;; Amin's motivations are more uncertain, but it is commonly believed that he associated with Taraki to protect his own position. Amin had attracted many enemies during his career, the most notable being Karmal. According to the official version of events, Taraki protected Amin from party members or others who wanted to hurt the PDPA and the country.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 54]}}

When [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] ousted the monarchy, and established the [[Republic of Afghanistan]], the Khalqist PDPA offered its support for the new regime if it established a National Front which presumably included the Khalqist PDPA itself. The Parchamite PDPA had already established an alliance with Daoud at the beginning of his regime, and Karmal called for the dissolution of the Khalqist PDPA. Karmal's call for dissolution only worsened relations between the Khalqist and Parchamite PDPA.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 55]}} However, Taraki and Amin were lucky; Karmal's alliance actually hurt the Parchamites' standing in Afghan politics. Some communists in the armed forces became disillusioned with the government of Daoud, and turned to the Khalqist PDPA because of its apparent independence. Parchamite association with the Daoud government indirectly led to the Khalqist-led PDPA coup of 1978, popularly referred to as the [[Saur Revolution]]. From 1973 until the 1978 coup, Amin was responsible for organising party work in the Afghan armed forces.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 56]}} According to the official version, Amin &quot;met patriotic liaison officers day or night, in the desert or the mountains, in the fields or the forests, enlightening them on the basis of the principles of the [[working class]] ideology.&quot; Amin's success in recruiting military officers lay in the fact that Daoud &quot;betrayed the left&quot; soon after taking power.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57]}} When Amin began recruiting military officers for the PDPA, it was not difficult for him to find disgruntled military officers. In the meantime, relations between the Parchamite and Khalqist PDPA deteriorated; in 1973 it was rumoured that Major [[Zia Mohammadzai]], a Parchamite and head of the [[Republican Guard (Afghanistan)|Republican Guard]], planned to assassinate the entire Khalqist leadership. The plan, if true, failed because the Khalqists found out about it.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 58]}}

The assassination attempt proved to be a further blow to relations between the Parchamites and Khalqists. The Parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate the Khalqist leadership, but historian Beverley Male argues that Karmal's subsequent activities give credence to the Khalqist view of events. Because of the Parchamite assassination attempt, Amin pressed the Khalqist PDPA to seize power in 1976 by ousting Daoud.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 58]}} The majority of the PDPA leadership voted against such a move.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 58–59]}} The following year, in 1977, the Parchamites and Khalqists officially reconciled, and the PDPA was unified. The Parchamite and Khalqist PDPAs, which had separate general secretaries, politburos, central committees and other organisational structures, were officially unified in the summer of 1977.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA52 52]}} One reason for unification was that the international communist movement, represented by the [[Communist Party of India]], [[Iraqi Communist Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Australia]], called for party unification.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&amp;pg=PA53 53]}}

===Saur Revolution===
{{further|Saur Revolution}}
On 18 April 1978 [[Mir Akbar Khyber]], the chief ideologue of the Parcham faction, was killed; he was commonly believed to have been assassinated by the Daoud government. Khyber's assassination initiated a chain of events which led to the PDPA taking power eleven days later, on 27 April.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA62 62]}} The assassin was never caught, but [[Anahita Ratebzad]], a Parchamite, believed that Amin had ordered the assassination.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58 58]}} Khyber's funeral evolved into a large anti-government demonstration. Daoud, who did not understand the significance of the events, began a mass arrest of PDPA members seven days after Khyber's funeral. Amin, who organised the subsequent revolution against Daoud, was one of the last Central Committee members to be arrested by the authorities. His late arrest can be considered as proof of the regime's lack of information; Amin was the leading revolutionary party organiser. The government's lack of awareness was proven by the arrest of Taraki – Taraki's arrest was the pre-arranged signal for the revolution to commence.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA62 62]}} When Amin found out that Taraki had been arrested, he ordered the revolution to begin at 9am on 27 April. Amin, in contrast to Taraki, was not imprisoned, but instead put under [[house arrest]]. His son, Abdur Rahman, was still allowed freedom of movement. The revolution was successful, thanks to overwhelming support from the Afghan military; for instance, it was supported by [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Defence Minister]] [[Ghulam Haidar Rasuli]], [[Aslam Watanjar]] the commander of the ground forces, and the Chief of Staff of the [[Afghan Air Force]], [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Abdul Qadir]].{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 63]}}

==PDPA rule==

===Khalq–Parcham break===
After the Saur revolution, Taraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]] and [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]], and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both [[Khalq]]ists and [[Parcham]]ites;{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council{{sfn|Brecher|Wilkenfeld|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&amp;pg=PA356 356]}} while Amin became [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} and a Deputy Prime Minister,{{sfn|Asthana|Nirmal|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EqWnqdsgZMC&amp;pg=PA219 219]}} and [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]] became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and [[Mohammad Rafi]] became [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]] and [[Ministry of Public Works (Afghanistan)|Minister of Public Works]] respectively.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}} According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led to the establishment of three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA70 70–71]}} The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}}

On 27 June 1978, three months after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA72 72–73]}} The meeting decided that the Khalqists had exclusive rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled, but was able to establish a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General [[Shahpur Ahmedzai]]. The coup was planned for 4 September, on the Festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers would be off duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and [[Mohammad Najibullah]] both stayed in their assigned countries.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA73 73]}}

===Amin–Taraki break===
The Afghan people revolted against the PDPA government when the government introduced several [[Socialism|socialist reforms]], including [[land reforms]]. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the [[1979 Herat uprising|Herat uprising]] began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the [[Mujahideen]] and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman.{{sfn|Isby|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k86jifnA3oYC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}} Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to ratify the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote on whether or not to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the [[Executive branch|executive]] (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to ratify the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA163 163–164]}}

}}
[[Alexander Puzanov]], the [[Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan]], was able to persuade [[Aslam Watanjar]], [[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]] and [[Sherjan Mazdoryar]] to become part of a conspiracy against Amin. These three men put pressure on Taraki, who by this time believed that &quot;he really was the 'great leader'&quot;, to sack Amin from office. It is unknown if Amin knew anything about the conspiracy against him, but it was after the cabinet reorganisation that he talked about his dissatisfaction. On 26 March the PDPA Politburo and the Council of Ministers approved the extension of the powers of the executive branch, and the establishment of the [[Homeland Higher Defence Council]] (HHDC) to handle security matters.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA163 163–164]}} Many analysts of the day regarded Amin's appointment as Prime Minister as an increase in his powers at the expense of Taraki. However, the reorganisation of the cabinet and the strengthening of Taraki's position as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, had reduced the authority of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was, due to the strengthening of the executive, now appointed by the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. While Amin could appoint and dismiss new ministers, he needed Taraki's consent to actually do so. Another problem for Amin was that while the Council of Ministers was responsible to the Revolutionary Council and its chairman, individual ministers were only responsible to Taraki. When Amin became Prime Minister, he was responsible for planning, finance and budgetary matters, the conduct of [[foreign policy]], and for order and security. The order and security responsibilities had been taken over by the HHDC, which was chaired by Taraki.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA164 164]}} While Amin was HHDC Deputy Chairman, the majority of HHDC members were members of the anti-Amin faction. For instance, the HHDC membership included Watanjar the [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]], [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Interior Minister]] Mazdoryar, the President of the Political Affairs of the Armed Forces [[Mohammad Iqbal (politician)|Mohammad Iqbal]], [[Mohammad Yaqub]], the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander of the [[Afghan Air Force]] [[Nazar Mohammad (politician)|Nazar Mohammad]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]] the head of [[KHAD|ASGA]], the Afghan secret police.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA164 164–165]}}

The [[order of precedence]] had been institutionalised, whereby Taraki was responsible for defence and Amin responsible for assisting Taraki in defence related matters. Amin's position was given a further blow by the democratisation of the decision-making process, which allowed its members to contribute; most of them were against Amin. Another problem for Amin was that the office of HHDC Deputy Chairman had no specific functions or powers, and the appointment of a new defence minister who opposed him drastically weakened his control over the Ministry of National Defence. The reorganisation of ministers was a further blow to Amin's position; he had lost control of the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the ASGA. Amin still had allies at the top, many of them in strategically important positions, for instance, Yaqub was his [[brother-in-law]] and the Security Chief in the Ministry of Interior was [[Sayed Daoud Taroon]], who was also later appointed to the HHDC as an ordinary member in April. Amin succeeded in appointing two more of his allies to important positions; [[Mohammad Sediq Alemyar]] as [[Ministry of Planning (Afghanistan)|Minister of Planning]] and [[Khayal Mohammad Katawazi]] as [[Ministry of Information, Culture (Afghanistan)|Minister of Information and Culture]]; and [[Faqir Mohammad Faqir]] was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in April 1978.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 165]}} Amin's political position was not secure when [[Alexei Yepishev]], the Head of the [[Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy]], visited Kabul.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 165–166]}} Yepishev met personally with Taraki on 7 April, but never met with Amin. The Soviets were becoming increasingly worried about Amin's control over the Afghan military.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 166]}} Even so, during Yepishev's visit Amin's position was actually strengthened; Taroon was appointed Taraki's aide-de-camp.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 166–167]}}

}}
Soon after, at two cabinet meetings, the strengthening of the executive powers of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council was proven. Even though Amin was Prime Minister, Taraki chaired the meetings instead of him. Amin's presence at these two meetings was not mentioned at all, and it was made clear that Taraki, through his office as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, also chaired the Council of Ministers. Another problem facing Amin was Taraki's policy of [[autocracy]]; he tried to deprive the [[Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Politburo]] of its powers as a party and state decision-making organ. The situation deteriorated when Amin personally warned Taraki that &quot;the prestige and popularity of leaders among the people has no common aspect with a [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].&quot;{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 167]}}

Factionalism within the PDPA made it ill prepared to handle the intensified [[counter-revolution]]ary activities in the country.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 171]}} Amin tried to win support for the communist government by depicting himself as a devout Muslim.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA177 177]}} Taraki and Amin blamed different countries for helping the counter-revolutionaries; Amin attacked the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) and played down American and Chinese involvement, while Taraki blamed [[American imperialism]] and [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]] for supporting the uprising. Amin's criticism of the United Kingdom and the BBC fed on the traditional anti-British sentiments held by rural Afghans. In contrast to Taraki, &quot;Amin bent over backwards to avoid making hostile reference to&quot;, China, the United States or other foreign governments.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 178]}} Amin's cautious behavior was in deep contrast to the Soviet Union's official stance on the situation; it seemed, according to Beverley Male, that the Soviet leadership tried to force a confrontation between Afghanistan and its enemies.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 178]}} Amin also tried to appease the [[Shia]] communities by meeting with their leaders; despite this, a section of the Shia leadership called for the continuation of the resistance. Subsequently a revolt broke out in a Shia populated district in Kabul; this was the first sign of unrest in Kabul since the [[Saur Revolution]].{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA179 179]}} To add to the government's problems, Taraki's ability to lead the country was questioned – he was a heavy drinker and was not in good health. Amin on the other hand was characterised in this period by portrayals of strong self-discipline. In the summer of 1979 Amin began to disassociate himself from Taraki.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA180 180]}} On 27 June Amin became a member of the PDPA Politburo, the leading decision-making body in Afghanistan.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA71 71–73]}}

===Rise to power===
In-mid July the Soviets made their view official when ''[[Pravda]]'' wrote an article about the situation in Afghanistan; the Soviets did not wish to see Amin become leader of Afghanistan. This triggered a political crisis in Afghanistan, as Amin initiated a policy of extreme repression, which became one of the main reasons for the Soviet intervention later that year.{{sfn|Brecher|Wilkenfeld|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&amp;pg=PA357 357]}} On 28 July, a vote in the PDPA Politburo approved Amin's proposal of creating a [[collective leadership]] with collective decision-making;{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&amp;pg=PA36 36]}} this was a blow to Taraki, and many of his supporters were replaced by pro-Amin PDPA members.{{sfn|Wahab|Youngerman|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y20MTE0C9kwC&amp;pg=PA150 150]}} [[Ivan Pavlovsky]], the Commander of the [[Soviet Army|Soviet Ground Forces]], visited Kabul in mid-August to study the situation in Afghanistan. Amin, in a speech just a few days after Pavlovsky's arrival, said that he wanted closer relations between Afghanistan and the [[China|People's Republic of China]]; in the same speech he hinted that he had reservations about Soviet meddling in Afghanistan. He likened Soviet assistance to Afghanistan with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s assistance to the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919. Taraki, a delegate to the conference held by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Havana]], met personally with [[Andrei Gromyko]], the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], to discuss the Afghanistan situation on 9 September. [[Shah Wali (politician)|Shah Wali]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], who was a supporter of Amin, did not participate in the meeting. This, according to Beverley Male, &quot;suggested that some plot against Amin was in preparation&quot;.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA184 184]}} Within hours of his return to Kabul on 11 September, Taraki convened the cabinet &quot;ostensibly to report on the Havana Summit&quot;. Instead of reporting on the summit, Taraki tried to dismiss Amin as Prime Minister. This was a miscalculation, and all but the [[Gang of Four (Afghanistan)|Gang of Four]] (consisting of Watanjar, Mazdoryar, Gulabzoi and Sarwari), supported retaining Amin as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 185]}}

Taraki sought to neutralise Amin's power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador. Amin turned down the proposal, shouting &quot;You are the one who should quit! Because of drink and old age you have taken leave of your senses.&quot; The following day Taraki invited Amin to the presidential palace for lunch with him and the Gang of Four. Amin turned down the offer, stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them. Soviet ambassador Puzanov persuaded Amin to make the visit to the Presidential Palace along with Taroon, the Chief of Police and [[Nawab Ali]] (an intelligence officer). Upon arriving at the palace, unknown individuals within the building opened fire on the visitors. Taroon was killed, while Ali sustained an injury and escaped, together with Amin, who was unharmed. Shortly afterward, Amin returned to the palace with a contingent of Army officers, and placed Taraki under arrest. The Gang of Four, however, had &quot;disappeared&quot; and their whereabouts would remain unknown for the duration of Amin's 104-day rule. After Taraki's arrest, Amin reportedly discussed the incident with [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and indirectly asked for the permission to kill Taraki. Brezhnev replied that it was his choice. Amin, who now believed he had the full support of the Soviets, ordered the death of Taraki. Taraki was subsequently suffocated with pillows. The Afghan media would report that the ailing Taraki had died, omitting any mention of his murder.{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=125}}

===Presidency===

====Domestic policies====
Following Taraki's fall from power, Amin was elected Chairman of the Presidum of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]] and General Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]] by the PDPA Politburo. The election of Amin as PDPA General Secretary and the removal of Taraki from all party posts was unanimous.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA48 48]}} The only members of the cabinet replaced when Amin took power were the Gang of Four – Beverley Male saw this as &quot;a clear indication that he had their [the ministers'] support&quot;.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 185]}} Amin's rise to power was followed by a policy of moderation, and attempts to persuade the Afghan people that the regime was not [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]]. Amin's government began to invest in the reconstruction, or reparation, of mosques. He also promised the Afghan people [[freedom of religion]]. Religious groups were given copies of the [[Quran]], and Amin began to refer to [[Allah]] in speeches. He even claimed that the Saur Revolution was &quot;totally based on the principles of Islam&quot;. The campaign proved to be unsuccessful, and many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime's [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian behavior]].{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&amp;pg=PA118 118]}} Amin's rise to power was officially endorsed by the [[Jamiatul Ulama (Afghanistan)|Jamiatul Ulama]] on 20 September 1979. Their endorsement led to the official announcement that Amin was a pious Muslim – Amin thus scored a point against the counter-revolutionary propaganda which claimed the communist regime was [[atheist]]. Amin also tried to increase his popularity with tribal groups, a feat Taraki had been unable or unwilling to achieve. In a speech to tribal elders Amin was defensive about the Western way he dressed; an official biography was published which depicted Amin in traditional Pashtun clothes. During his short stay in power, Amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership; when Taraki was ousted, Amin promised &quot;from now on there will be no [[Autocracy|one-man government]]...&quot;{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}

Attempting to pacify the population, Amin released a list of 18,000 people who had been executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA273 273]}} Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the [[Afghan military]] deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 in the immediate aftermath of the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA160 160]}} While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] were agitating for his removal. [[Babrak Karmal]], the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]], [[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]] wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA160 160–161]}}

====Foreign policy====
When Amin became leader, he tried to reduce Afghanistan's dependence on the Soviet Union. To accomplish this, he aimed to balance Afghanistan's relations with the Soviet Union by strengthening relations with [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. The Soviets were concerned when they received reports that Amin had met personally with [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], one of the leading anti-communists in Afghanistan. His general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst Afghans made it more difficult for Amin to find new &quot;foreign patrons&quot;.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA159 159]}} Amin's involvement in the death of [[Adolph Dubs]], the [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan|American Ambassador to Afghanistan]], strained his relations with the United States. He tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact, met with three different American [[chargé d'affaires]], and was interviewed by an American correspondent. But this did not improve Afghanistan's standing in the eyes of the United States Government. After the third meeting with Amin, [[J. Bruce Amstutz]], the American Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1979 to 1980, believed the wisest thing to do was to maintain &quot;a low profile, trying to avoid issues, and waiting to see what happens&quot;.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA160 160]}} In early December 1979, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between Amin and [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], the [[President of Pakistan]]. The Pakistani Government, accepting a modified version of the offer, agreed to send [[Agha Shahi]], the Pakistani foreign minister, to [[Kabul]] for talks. In the meanwhile, the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), Pakistani's secret police, continued to train [[Mujahideen]] fighters who opposed the communist regime.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA160 160]}}

Contrary to popular belief, the Soviet leadership headed by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Alexei Kosygin]] and the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], were not eager to send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of [[Yuri Andropov]] the [[KGB Chairman]], [[Andrei Gromyko]] the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Defence Minister]] [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], and [[Boris Ponomarev]], the head of the [[Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|International Department of the Central Committee]].{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}} The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], &quot;Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now our mission is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there.&quot;{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA89 89]}} Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to [[Moscow]] by [[Alexander Puzanov]], the [[List of Ambassadors of Russia and the Soviet Union to Afghanistan|Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan]], because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about &quot;the undesirable turn of events&quot; taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA89 89]}} Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA89 89–90]}} By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with [[Babrak Karmal]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]].{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA90 90]}}

}}
As it turned out, the relationship between Puzanov and Amin broke down. Amin started a smear campaign to discredit Puzanov. This in turn led to an assassination attempt against Amin, in which Puzanov participated. The situation was worsened by the [[KGB]] accusing Amin of misrepresenting the Soviet position on Afghanistan in the PDPA Central Committee and the Revolutionary Council. The KGB also noted an increase in anti-Soviet agitation by the government during Amin's rule, and harassment against Soviet citizens increased under Amin.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA50 50]}} A group of senior politicians reported to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Central Committee]] that it was necessary to do &quot;everything possible&quot; to prevent a change in political orientation in Afghanistan. However, the Soviet leadership did not advocate intervention at this time, and instead called for increasing its influence in the Amin leadership to expose his &quot;true intentions&quot;.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA50 50–51]}} A Soviet Politburo assessment referred to Amin as &quot;a power-hungry leader who is distinguished by brutality and treachery&quot;.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA162 162]}} Amongst the many sins they alleged were his &quot;insincerity and duplicity&quot; when dealing with the Soviet Union, creating fictitious accusations against PDPA-members who opposed him, indulging in a policy of [[nepotism]], and his tendency to conduct a more &quot;balanced policy&quot; towards [[First World]] countries.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA162 162–163]}}

By the end of October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end the impression that the Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's [[First Chief Directorate]] was put under orders that something had to be done about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA54 54]}} Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}} The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated [[Operation Storm-333]] (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.{{sfn|Camp|2012|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yMmx1m_ZCqEC&amp;pg=PA12 12–13]}}

Amin trusted the Soviet Union until the very end, despite the deterioration of official relations. When the Afghan intelligence service handed Amin a report that the Soviet Union would invade the country and topple him, Amin claimed the report was a product of [[imperialism]]. His view can be explained by the fact that the Soviet Union, after several months, finally gave in to Amin's demands and sent troops into Afghanistan to secure the PDPA government.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&amp;pg=PA1009 1009] }} Contrary to common Western belief, Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to send troops into Afghanistan.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&amp;pg=PA1017 1017]}} General Tukharinov, Commander of the 40th Army, met with Afghan Major General Babadzhan to talk about Soviet troop movements before the Soviet army's intervention.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9FjkLLEyh1UC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}} On 25 December [[Dmitriy Ustinov]] issued a formal order, stating &quot;The state frontier of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] is to be crossed on the ground and in the air by forces of the 40th Army and the Air Force at 1500 hrs on 25 December&quot;. This was the formal beginning of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=86}}

Concerned for his safety, Amin moved from the Presidential Palace, in the centre of Kabul, to the [[Tajbeg Palace]], which had previously been the headquarters of the Central Army Corps of the Afghan military. The palace was formidable, with walls strong enough to withstand artillery fire. According to [[Rodric Braithwaite]], &quot;its defences had been carefully and intelligently organised&quot;.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=89}} All roads to the palace had been mined, with the exception of one, which had heavy machine guns and artillery positioned to defend it. To make matters worse for the Soviets, the Afghans had established a second line of defence which consisted of seven posts, &quot;each manned by four sentries armed with a machine gun, a mortar, and automatic rifles&quot;.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=89}} The external defences of the palace were handled by the Presidential Guard, which consisted of 2,500 troops and three [[T-54 tank]]s.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=89}} Several Soviet commanders involved in the assassination of Amin thought the plan to attack the palace was &quot;crazy&quot;.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}} Several soldiers hesitated, claiming, in contradiction of what their commanders [[Yuri Drozdov (general)|Yuri Drozdov]] and [[Vasily Kolesnik]] had told them (they in turn had been informed by the Soviet leadership), it seemed strange that Amin, the leader of the PDPA government, was an American sympathiser{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}} (accused of being a &quot;CIA agent&quot; by the Soviets){{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&amp;pg=PA1046 1046]}} and betrayed the Saur Revolution. Despite several objections, the plan to assassinate Amin went ahead.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}}

Before resorting to killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets had tried to poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot on his way to work (this proved impossible as the Afghans had improved their security measures).{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}} They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate [[Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri]]'s return from [[Moscow]]. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. [[Mikhail Talybov]], a [[KGB]] agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=95}}

[[File:Paradise Lost 12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1866).The spiritual descent of [[Lucifer]] into [[Satan]] is one of the most famous examples of hubris.]]
'''Hubris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|b|r|ɪ|s}}, also '''hybris''', from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὕβρις|ὕβρις]]}}) describes a personality quality of extreme or foolish [[pride]] or dangerous [[confidence|overconfidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hubris|title=Definition of HUBRIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ancient Greek context, it typically describes behavior that defies the norms of behavior or challenges the gods, and which in turn brings about the downfall, or [[nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]], of the perpetrator of hubris.

The adjectival form of the noun ''hubris'' is &quot;hubristic&quot;. Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from the wrongful act. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. Contrary to common expectations,{{by whom?|date=September 2017}} hubris is not necessarily associated with high [[self-esteem]] but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem, and a gap between inflated self perception and a more modest reality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[C. S. Lewis]] wrote in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that pride is the &quot;anti-God&quot; state, the position in which the [[wikt:ego#English|ego]] and the self are directly opposed to [[God]]: &quot;Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mere Christianity : a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |year=2001 |first1=C.S. |last1=Lewis |authorlink1=C.S. Lewis |isbn=978-0-06-065292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greek origin ==
In [[ancient Greek]], ''hubris'' referred to actions that shamed and humiliated the victim for the pleasure or gratification of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, &quot;Law, society and homosexuality or hermaphrodity in Classical Athens&quot; in ''Studies in ancient Greek and Roman society'' By Robin Osborne; p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The term had a strong sexual connotation, and the shame reflected upon the perpetrator as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society |last= Cartledge|first= |authorlink= Paul Cartledge |author2=Paul Millett |year= 2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-52209-0|page= 123 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3nCSw5Cr4PUC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate= 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of the law against hubris included what might today be termed [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]; sexual crimes; or the theft of public or sacred property. Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first [[Midias]] punched Demosthenes in the face in the theatre (''[[Against Midias]]''), and second when (in ''Against Conon'') a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim. Yet another example of hubris appears in [[Aeschines]]' ''[[Against Timarchus]]'', where the defendant, Timarchus, is accused of breaking the law of hubris by submitting himself to prostitution and anal intercourse. Aeschines brought this suit against Timarchus to bar him from the rights of political office and his case succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines &quot;Against Timarchus&quot; from Thomas K. Hubbard's ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Athens, hubris was defined as the use of violence to shame the victim (this sense of hubris could also characterize rape&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubris|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Aristotle]] defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for that committer's own gratification:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1378b ''Rhetoric'' 1378b].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=No mention of Hubris on page cited nor found in 'Rhetoric' on the Tufts site|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Law, Violence, and Community in Classical Athens|page=145|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ9GjorvJGkC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=0521388376|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eros&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Paul W.|title=Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory|page=178|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqTEy-til8C&amp;pg=PA172|isbn=1139434179|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of [[honour]] (τιμή, ''timē'') and shame (αἰδώς, ''[[aidos|aidōs]]''). The concept of honour included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honour is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition of hubris to the contemporary concept of &quot;insolence, contempt, and excessive violence&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In Greek mythology, when a figure's hubris offends the [[Gods]] of ancient Greece, it is usually punished; examples of such hubristic, sinful humans include [[Icarus]], [[Phaethon]], [[Arachne]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Niobe]], [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Tereus]].

== Modern usage ==
In its modern usage, hubris denotes overconfident pride combined with arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Picone, P. M., Dagnino, G. B., &amp; Minà, A.|title=. The origin of failure: A multidisciplinary appraisal of the hubris hypothesis and proposed research agenda|journal=The Academy of Management Perspectives|date=2014|volume=28 |issue=4|pages=447–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubris is often associated with a lack of [[humility]]. Sometimes a person's hubris is also associated with ignorance. The accusation of hubris often implies that suffering or punishment will follow, similar to the occasional pairing of hubris and [[Nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]] in Greek mythology. The proverb &quot;pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall&quot; (from the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]], 16:18) is thought to sum up the modern use of hubris. Hubris is also referred to as &quot;pride that blinds&quot; because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1920 Farrow's Bank Failure: A Case of Managerial Hubris|url=https://www.academia.edu/6081830/The_1920_Farrows_Bank_Failure_A_Case_of_Managerial_Hubris|publisher=Durham University |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, &quot;that pride that goes just before the fall.&quot;

Examples of hubris are often found in literature, most famously in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which [[Lucifer]] attempts to compel the other angels to worship him, is cast into hell by God and the innocent angels, and proclaims: &quot;Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.&quot; Victor in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' manifests hubris in his attempt to become a great scientist by creating life through technological means, but comes to regret his project. [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' portrays the eponymous character as a scholar whose arrogance and pride compel him to sign a [[deal with the Devil]], and retain his haughtiness until his death and damnation, despite the fact that he could easily have repented had he chosen to do so.

A historical example of hubris was furnished by [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in the decisions that culminated in the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]; Custer is apocryphally quoted as having exclaimed: &quot;Where did all those damned Indians come from?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lev7YeUk7H0C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Where+did+all+those+damned+indians+come+from&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=52FAdoZNxG&amp;sig=Zm4zGjSr68YddlyMEx3KqWHbrac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI9MeE0__iyAIVAX0mCh2S1ATy#v=onepage&amp;q=Where%20did%20all%20those%20damned%20indians%20come%20from&amp;f=false |title=The Words of Others: From Quotations to Culture |first1=Gary Saul |last1=Morson |page=176 |isbn=9780300167474 |location=New Haven.

'''Heavy water''' ('''deuterium oxide''', '''{{Chem|2|H|2|O}}''', '''{{Chem|D|2|O}}''') is a form of [[water (molecule)|water]] that contains a larger than normal amount of the [[hydrogen isotope]] [[deuterium]] ({{Chem|2|H}} or D, also known as ''heavy hydrogen''), rather than the common [[hydrogen-1]] isotope ({{Chem|1|H}} or H, also called [[Diprotium|protium]]) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=heavy water|file=H02758}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal &quot;light water&quot;.

==Explanation==
Deuterium is a hydrogen isotope with a nucleus containing a [[neutron]] and a [[proton]]; the nucleus of a protium (normal hydrogen) atom consists of just a proton. The additional neutron makes a deuterium atom roughly twice as heavy as a protium atom.

A molecule of heavy water has two deuterium atoms in place of the two protium atoms of ordinary &quot;light&quot; water. The weight of a heavy water molecule, however, is not substantially different from that of a normal water molecule, because about 89% of the molecular weight of water comes from the single [[oxygen]] atom rather than the two hydrogen atoms. The colloquial term ''heavy water'' refers to a highly enriched water mixture that contains mostly deuterium oxide {{chem|D|2|O}}, but also some hydrogen-deuterium oxide (HDO) and a smaller number of ordinary hydrogen oxide {{chem|H|2|O}} molecules. For instance, the heavy water used in [[CANDU reactor]]s is 99.75% enriched by hydrogen atom-fraction—meaning that 99.75% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type. For comparison, [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|ordinary water]] (the &quot;ordinary water&quot; used for a deuterium standard) contains only about 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms, meaning that 0.0156% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type.

Heavy water is not [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. In its pure form, it has a density about 11% greater than water, but is otherwise physically and chemically similar. Nevertheless, the various differences in deuterium-containing water (especially affecting the biological properties) are larger than in any other commonly occurring [[isotopologue|isotope-substituted compound]] because deuterium is unique among heavy [[stable isotope]]s in being twice as heavy as the lightest isotope. This difference increases the [[bond energy|strength]] of water's hydrogen-oxygen bonds, and this in turn is enough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions. The human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to about five grams of heavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (&gt; 50%) in higher organisms is replaced by heavy water, the result is cell dysfunction and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10535697 |title=Pharmacological uses and perspectives of heavy water and deuterated compounds |author1=D.

Heavy water was first produced in 1932, a few months after the discovery of deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/fac-bios/brus/group/pages/urey.html| title = Harold Clayton Urey (1893–1981)|work = [[Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in late 1938, and the need for a [[neutron moderator]] that captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] research. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of reactors, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes for nuclear weapons. These [[heavy water reactor]]s have the advantage of being able to run on natural uranium without using [[graphite]] moderators that pose radiological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/ngwm-cd/PDF-Files/paper%2017%20(Holt).pdf |format=PDF |title=RADIOACTIVE GRAPHITE MANAGEMENT AT UK MAGNOX NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS |website=Pub-iaea.org |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dust explosion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cigr.ageng2012.org/images/fotosg/tabla_137_C0371.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422132744/http://cigr.ageng2012.org/images/fotosg/tabla_137_C0371.pdf |archivedate=22 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; hazards in the decommissioning phase. Most modern reactors use [[enriched uranium]] with ordinary water as the moderator.

==Other heavy forms of water==
===Semiheavy water===
'''Semiheavy water''', HDO, exists whenever there is water with light hydrogen (protium, {{chem|1|H}}) and deuterium (D or {{chem|2|H}}) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (hydrogen-1 and deuterium) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% H and 50% D in its hydrogen actually contains about 50% HDO and 25% each of {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}}, in [[dynamic equilibrium]].
In normal water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (one hydrogen in 6,400 is in the form of D), and heavy water molecules ({{chem|D|2|O}}) only occur in a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e. one in 6,400&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus [[semiheavy water]] molecules are far more common than &quot;pure&quot; (homoisotopic) heavy water molecules.

===Heavy-oxygen water===
Water enriched in the heavier oxygen isotopes [[oxygen-17|{{chem|17|O}}]] and [[oxygen-18|{{chem|18|O}}]] is also commercially available, e.g., for [[doubly labeled water|use as a non-radioactive isotopic tracer]]. It is &quot;heavy water&quot; as it is denser than normal water ({{chem|H|2}}{{chem|18|O}} is approximately as dense as {{chem|D|2|O}}, {{chem|H|2}}{{chem|17|O}} is about halfway between {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}})—but is rarely called heavy water, since it does not contain the deuterium that gives D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O its unusual nuclear and biological properties. It is more expensive than D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O due to the more difficult separation of &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;Mosin, O. V, Ignatov, I. (2011) Separation of Heavy Isotopes Deuterium (D) and Tritium (T) and Oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) in Water Treatment, Clean Water: Problems and Decisions, Moscow, No. 3–4, pp. 69–78.&lt;/ref&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is also used for production of [[fluorine-18]] for [[radiopharmaceutical]]s and [[radiotracer]]s and for [[positron emission tomography]].

===Tritiated water===
[[Tritiated water]] contains [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) in place of protium (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) or deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H), and therefore is radioactive.

The physical properties of water and heavy water differ in several respects. Heavy water is less dissociated than light water at given temperature, and the true concentration of D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is less than {{H+}} ions would be for a light water sample at the same temperature. The same is true of OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; vs. {{OH-}} ions. For heavy water Kw D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (25.0&amp;nbsp;°C) = 1.35 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;, and [D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{hsp}}] must equal [OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{hsp}}] for neutral water. Thus pKw D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = p[OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] + p[D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 7.44 + 7.44 = 14.87 (25.0&amp;nbsp;°C), and the p[D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] of neutral heavy water at 25.0&amp;nbsp;°C is 7.44.

The pD of heavy water is generally measured using pH electrodes giving a pH (apparent) value, or pHa, and at various temperatures a true acidic pD can be estimated from the directly pH meter measured pHa, such that pD+ = pHa (apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.41.  The electrode correction for alkaline conditions is 0.456 for heavy water. The alkaline correction is then pD+ = PHa(apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.456. These corrections are slightly different from the differences in p[D+] and p[OD-] of 0.44 from the corresponding ones in heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuceng.ca/candu/pdf/15%20-%20Chemistry%20in%20CANDU%20Process%20Systems.pdf discussion of pD+],&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy water is 10.6% denser than ordinary water, and heavy water's physically different properties can be seen without equipment if a frozen sample is dropped into normal water, as it will sink. If the water is ice-cold the higher melting temperature of heavy ice can also be observed: it melts at 3.7&amp;nbsp;°C, and thus does not melt in ice-cold normal water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |title=How 2.0 |accessdate=21 January 2008 |last=Gray |first=Theodore |date=2007 |work= |publisher=Popular Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216010940/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |archivedate=16 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No physical properties are listed for &quot;pure&quot; semi-heavy water, because it is unstable as a bulk liquid. In the liquid state, a few water molecules are always in an [[Self-ionisation of water|ionised state]], which means the hydrogen atoms can exchange among different oxygen atoms. Semi-heavy water could, in theory, be created via a chemical method, but it would rapidly transform into a dynamic mixture of 25% light water, 25% heavy water, and 50% semi-heavy water.  However, if it were made in the gas phase and directly [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] into a solid, semi heavy water in the form of ice could be stable. This is due to collisions between water vapour molecules being almost completely negligible in the gas phase at standard temperatures, and once crystallized collisions between the molecules cease altogether due to the rigid lattice structure of solid ice.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Effect on biological systems==
Different [[isotopes]] of chemical elements have slightly different chemical behaviors, but for most elements the differences are far too small to use, or even detect. For hydrogen, however, this is not true. The larger chemical isotope-effects seen between protium (light hydrogen) versus deuterium and [[tritium]] manifest because bond energies in chemistry are determined in quantum mechanics by equations in which the quantity of [[reduced mass]] of the nucleus and electrons appears. This quantity is altered in heavy-hydrogen compounds (of which deuterium oxide is the most common) more than for heavy-isotope substitution in other chemical elements. This isotope effect of heavy hydrogen is magnified further in biological systems, which are very sensitive to small changes in the solvent properties of water.

Heavy water is the only known chemical substance that affects the period of [[circadian rhythm|circadian oscillations]], consistently increasing the length of each cycle. The effect is seen in unicellular organisms, green plants, isopods, insects, birds, mice, and hamsters. The mechanism is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A Differential Effect of Heavy Water on Temperature-Dependent and Temperature-Compensated Aspects of the Circadian System of Drosophila pseudoobscura |author1=Pittendrigh, C.

Mammals (for example, [[rat]]s) given heavy water to drink die after a week, at a time when their body water approaches about 50% deuteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = J.F. | year = 1960 | title = Physiological Effects of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in Mammals.

It is more toxic to malignant cells than normal cells but the concentrations needed are too high for regular use.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt; As in chemotherapy, deuterium-poisoned mammals die of a failure of bone marrow (bleeding and infection) and intestinal-barrier functions ([[diarrhea]] and fluid loss).

Despite the problems of plants and animals in living with too much deuterium, [[prokaryotic]] organisms such as bacteria, which do not have the mitotic problems induced by deuterium, may be grown and propagated in fully deuterated conditions, resulting in replacement of all hydrogen atoms in the bacterial proteins and DNA with the deuterium isotope.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trotsenko, Y. A., Khmelenina, V. N., Beschastny, A. P. (1995) The Ribulose Monophosphate (Quayle) Cycle: News and Views. Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds, in: Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds (Lindstrom M.E., Tabita F.R., eds.). San Diego (USA), Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full replacement with heavy atom isotopes can be accomplished in higher organisms with other non-radioactive heavy isotopes (such as carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and oxygen-18), but this cannot be done for the stable heavy isotope of hydrogen.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Deuterium oxide is used to enhance [[boron neutron capture therapy]], but this effect does not rely on the biological effects of deuterium per se, but instead on deuterium's ability to moderate (slow) neutrons without capturing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt;

===Toxicity in humans===
Because it would take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being's body water (water being in turn 50–75% of body weight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = P. E. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1980 | title = Total body water volumes for adult males and females estimated from simple anthropometric measurements | url = | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 27–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) with heavy water, accidental or intentional [[poison]]ing with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning would require that the victim ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects.

Oral doses of heavy water in the range of several grams, as well as [[Oxygen-18|heavy oxygen]] &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, are routinely used in human metabolic experiments. See [[doubly labeled water]] testing. Since one in about every 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, a 50&amp;nbsp;kg human containing 32&amp;nbsp;kg of body water would normally contain enough deuterium (about 1.1&amp;nbsp;g) to make 5.5&amp;nbsp;g of pure heavy water, so roughly this dose is required to double the amount of deuterium in the body.&lt;!--- atomic mass of water, taking into account the three isotopes of hydrogen and the three of oxygen, is 18.01527; 32 kg of water is thus 1776.27 mol. Figuring in the abundances, we get 1.114014 g of deuterium (0.553258 mol); if we mix this with half as many moles of mean oxygen (0.138359 mol × 15.99930457 mol/g), we get 5.54 g of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ---&gt;

The American patent {{US patent|5223269}} is for the use of heavy water to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). A loss of blood pressure may partially explain the reported incidence of dizziness upon ingestion of heavy water. However, it is more likely that this symptom can be attributed to altered [[vestibular system|vestibular function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Money|author2=Myles|title=Heavy water nystagmus and effects of alcohol|journal=Nature|date=February 1974|volume=247|pages=404–405|doi=10.1038/247404a0|pmid=4544739|bibcode = 1974Natur.247..404M|first1=K. E.|issue=5440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy water radiation contamination confusion===
Although many people associate heavy water primarily with its use in nuclear reactors, pure heavy water is not radioactive. Commercial-grade heavy water is slightly radioactive due to the presence of minute traces of natural tritium, but the same is true of ordinary water. Heavy water that has been used as a coolant in nuclear power plants contains substantially more tritium as a result of neutron bombardment of the deuterium in the heavy water ([[Tritium#Health risks|tritium is a health risk]] when ingested in large quantities).

In 1990, a disgruntled employee at the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]] in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a &quot;half cup&quot;) of heavy water from the primary heat transport loop of the [[nuclear reactor]], and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving [[bioassay]] urine samples with elevated [[tritium]] levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.at/nni/site.php?site=Point++Lepreau |title=Point Lepreau in Canada |publisher=NNI (No Nukes Inforesource) |accessdate=10 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070710224724/http://www.ecology.at/nni/site.php?site=Point++Lepreau &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, and some of the public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.&lt;ref&gt;

==Production==
On [[Earth]], deuterated water, HDO, occurs naturally in normal water at a proportion of about 1 molecule in 3,200. This means that 1 in 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, which is 1 part in 3,200 by weight (hydrogen weight). The HDO may be separated from normal water by [[distillation]] or [[electrolysis]] and also by various chemical exchange processes, all of which exploit a [[kinetic isotope effect]]. (For more information about the isotopic distribution of deuterium in water, see [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]].)  In theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor, but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.

The difference in mass between the two hydrogen isotopes translates into a difference in the [[zero-point energy]] and thus into a slight difference in the speed of the reaction. Once HDO becomes a significant fraction of the water, heavy water becomes more prevalent as water molecules trade hydrogen atoms very frequently. Production of pure heavy water by distillation or electrolysis requires a large cascade of stills or electrolysis chambers and consumes large amounts of power, so the chemical methods are generally preferred.

The most cost-effective process for producing heavy water is the dual temperature exchange sulphide process (known as the [[Girdler sulfide process]]) developed in parallel by [[Karl-Hermann Geib]] and [[Jerome S. Spevack]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=HW&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0206076.pdf |title=An Early History of Heavy Water |last=Waltham |first=Chris |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |date=August 1998 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=4620909 |title=Method for isotope replenishment in an exchange liquid used in a laser |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; patented by Graham M. Keyser, uses [[lasers]] to selectively dissociate deuterated [[hydrofluorocarbons]] to form deuterium [[fluoride]], which can then be separated by physical means. Although the energy consumption for this process is much less than for the Girdler sulfide process, this method is currently uneconomical due to the expense of procuring the necessary hydrofluorocarbons.

As noted, modern commercial heavy water is almost universally referred to, and sold as, '''deuterium oxide'''. It is most often sold in various grades of purity, from 98% enrichment to 99.75–99.98% deuterium enrichment (nuclear reactor grade) and occasionally even higher isotopic purity.

===Argentina===
[[Argentina]] is the main producer of heavy water, using an ammonia/hydrogen exchange based plant supplied by Switzerland's [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] company. It is also a major exporter to Canada, USA, Germany, and other countries. The heavy water production facility located at Arroyito (Neuquén Province) is the world's largest heavy water production facility. Argentina produces 200 tons of heavy water per year using, not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S bithermal method, but ''monothermal ammonia-hydrogen isotopic
exchange''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trimodbesta.com/ru/references/references-plant-engineering.html?getFile=ApplicationInformation_BAG_201510/500_plant/AI_BAG_Arroyito_HeavyWater_LTG501EN1510_English_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Trimod Besta : Arroyito Heavy Water Production Plant, Argentina |website=Trimodbesta.com |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
In October 1939, [[Soviet]] [[physicists]] [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and  [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton]] concluded that heavy water and carbon were the only feasible moderators for a natural uranium reactor, and in August 1940, along with [[Georgy Flyorov]], submitted a plan to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] calculating that 15 tons of heavy water were needed for a reactor.  With the [[Soviet Union]] having no uranium mines at the time, young Academy workers were sent to Leningrad photographic shops to buy uranium nitrate, but the entire heavy water project was halted in 1941 when German forces invaded during [[Operation Barbarossa]].

By 1943, Soviet scientists had discovered that all scientific literature relating to heavy water had disappeared from the West, which Flyorov in a letter warned Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] about, and at which time there was only 2–3&amp;nbsp;kg of heavy water in the entire country.  In late 1943, the Soviet purchasing commission in the U.S. obtained 1&amp;nbsp;kg of heavy water and a further 100&amp;nbsp;kg in February 1945, and upon [[World War II]] ending, the [[NKVD]] took over the project.

In October 1946, as part of the [[Russian Alsos]], the [[NKVD]] deported to the [[Soviet Union]] from [[Germany]] the German scientists who had worked on heavy water production during the war, including the inventor of the [[Girdler sulfide process]] [[Karl-Hermann Geib]].  These German scientists worked under the supervision of [[Germany|German]] [[physical chemist]]  [[Max Volmer]] at the Institute of Physical Chemistry in [[Moscow]] with the plant they constructed producing large quantities of heavy water by 1948.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/72pavel.pdf |title=German Scientists in the Soviet Atomic Project  |last=Oleynikov |first=Pavel V. |publisher=The Nonproliferation Review |date=2000 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
During the [[Manhattan Project]] the United States constructed three heavy water production plants as part of the [[P-9 Project]] at Morgantown Ordnance Works, near [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]; at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, near Dana and [[Newport, Indiana]]; and at the Alabama Ordnance Works, near Childersburg and [[Sylacauga, Alabama]]. Heavy water was also acquired from the Cominco plant in [[Trail, British Columbia]], Canada. The [[Chicago Pile-3]] experimental reactor used heavy water as a moderator and went critical in 1944. The three domestic production plants were shut down in 1945 after producing around 20 metric tons of product{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} (around 20,000 litres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://convert-to.com/conversion/water-weight-volume/convert-metric-tonne-t-water-weight-to-liter-l-of-water-volume.html |title=Convert metric tonnes of water to liters of water &amp;#124; water volume vs. weight conversion |website=Convert-to.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wabash plant was reopened and began resumption of heavy water production in 1952.

In 1953, the United States began using heavy water in [[plutonium]] production reactors at the [[Savannah River Site]]. The first of the five heavy water reactors came online in 1953, and the last was placed in cold shutdown in 1996. The SRS reactors were heavy water reactors so that they could produce both plutonium and [[tritium]] for the US nuclear weapons program.

The U.S. developed the [[Girdler sulfide process|Girdler sulfide]] chemical exchange production process—which was first demonstrated on a large scale at the [[Dana, Indiana]] plant in 1945 and at the Savannah River Plant, South Carolina in 1952. [[DuPont]] operated the SRP for the USDOE until 1 April 1989, when [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] took it over.

===India===
India is one of the world's largest producers of heavy water through its [[Heavy Water Board]] and also exports to countries like Republic of Korea and the US. Development of heavy water process in India happened in three phases: The first phase (late 1950s to mid-1980s) was a period of technology development, the second phase was of deployment of technology and process stabilisation (mid-1980s to early 1990s) and third phase saw consolidation and a shift towards improvement in production and energy conservation.

===Empire of Japan===
In the 1930s, it was suspected by the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] that Austrian chemist [[Fritz Johann Hansgirg]] built a pilot plant for the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese ruled northern Korea]] to produce heavy water by using a new process he had invented.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://www.academia.edu/7850196/1945_When_Korea_Faced_Its_Post-Colonial_Future |title=1945: When Korea Faced Its Post-Colonial Future |last=Streifer |first=Bill |publisher=[[Academia.edu]] |date= |accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main|Norwegian heavy water sabotage}}
[[File:Deuterium oxide Norsk.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Heavy water&quot; made by [[Norsk Hydro]]]]
In 1934, [[Norsk Hydro]] built the first commercial heavy water plant at [[Vemork]], [[Tinn]], with a capacity of 12 tonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Norsk Hydro Rjukan]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 and throughout [[World War II]], the plant was under [[Nazi Germany|German]] control and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] decided to destroy the plant and its heavy water to inhibit German development of nuclear weapons. In late 1942, a planned raid by British airborne troops failed, both gliders crashing. The raiders were killed in the crash or subsequently executed by the Germans. On the night of 27 February 1943 [[Operation Gunnerside]] succeeded. Norwegian commandos and local resistance managed to demolish small, but key parts of the electrolytic cells, dumping the accumulated heavy water down the factory drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Thomas|title=Assault In Norway: Sabotaging the Nazi Nuclear Program|publisher=The Lyons Press|year=2002|location=Guilford, Connecticut|isbn=1585747505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 1943, the Allied air forces dropped more than 400 bombs on the site. The Allied air raid prompted the Nazi government to move all available heavy water to Germany for safekeeping. On 20 February 1944, a Norwegian partisan sank the ferry [[SF Hydro|M/F&amp;nbsp;''Hydro'']] carrying heavy water across [[Lake Tinn]], at the cost of 14 Norwegian civilian lives, and most of the heavy water was presumably lost. A few of the barrels were only half full, and therefore could float, and may have been salvaged and transported to Germany.

Recent investigation of production records at Norsk Hydro and analysis of an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004&lt;!--reference: documentary on PBS/Discovery Channel--&gt; revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of [[pH]]&amp;nbsp;14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=NOVA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3216_hydro.html |title=Hitler's Sunken Secret (transcript) |publisher=NOVA Web site |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |author=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent size of the shipment, the total quantity of pure heavy water was quite small, most barrels only containing 0.5–1% pure heavy water. The Germans would have needed a total of about 5 tons of heavy water to get a nuclear reactor running.&lt;!--reference: documentary on Nova / Hitler's Sunken Treasure--&gt; The manifest clearly indicated that there was only half a ton of heavy water being transported to Germany. ''Hydro'' was carrying far too little heavy water for one reactor, let alone the 10 or more tons needed to make enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA&quot;/&gt;

Israel admitted running the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|Dimona reactor]] with Norwegian heavy water sold to it in 1959. Through re-export using Romania and Germany, India probably also used Norwegian heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinproject.org/pubs/editorials/1988/3scandals.htm &quot;3 Scandals Oslo Must Put to Rest&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423220548/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/pubs/editorials/1988/3scandals.htm |date=23 April 2012 }}.

===Canada===
As part of its contribution to the [[Manhattan Project]], Canada built and operated a 6-tonnes-per-year electrolytic heavy water plant at [[Trail, British Columbia]], which started operation in 1943.

The Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) design of power reactor requires large quantities of heavy water to act as a [[neutron moderator]] and coolant. AECL ordered two heavy water plants, which were built and operated in [[Atlantic Canada]] at [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]] (by Deuterium of Canada Limited) and [[Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia]] (by General Electric Canada). These plants proved to have significant design, construction and production problems and so AECL built the Bruce Heavy Water Plant ({{Coord|44.1854|-81.3618|type:landmark_region:CA|name=Bruce Heavy Water Plant|display=inline}}),&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; which it later sold to [[Ontario Hydro]], to ensure a reliable supply of heavy water for future power plants. The two Nova Scotia plants were shut down in 1985 when their production proved unnecessary.

The Bruce Heavy Water Plant in [[Ontario]] was the world's largest heavy water production plant with a capacity of 700 tonnes per year. It used the [[Girdler sulfide process]] to produce heavy water, and required 340,000 tonnes of feed water to produce one tonne of heavy water. It was part of a complex that included eight [[CANDU reactor]]s, which provided heat and power for the heavy water plant. The site was located at [[Douglas Point]] near Tiverton, Ontario on [[Lake Huron]] where it had access to the waters of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]].

The Bruce plant was commissioned in 1979 to provide heavy water for a large increase in Ontario's nuclear power generation. The plants were significantly more efficient than planned and only three of the planned four units were eventually commissioned. In addition, the nuclear power programme was slowed down and effectively stopped due to a perceived oversupply of electricity, later shown to be temporary, in 1993. Improved efficiency in the use and recycling of heavy water plus the over-production at Bruce left Canada with enough heavy water for its anticipated future needs. Also, the [[Girdler sulfide process|Girdler process]] involves large amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]], raising environmental concerns if there should be a release. The Bruce heavy water plant was shut down in 1997, after which the plant was gradually dismantled and the site cleared.

[[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) is currently researching other more efficient and environmentally benign processes for creating heavy water. This is essential for the future of the CANDU reactors since heavy water represents about 20% of the capital cost of each reactor.

===Iran===
Since 1996 [[IR-40|a plant]] for production of heavy water was being constructed at Khondab near [[Arak, Iran|Arak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/arak-hwpp.htm|title=Arak – Heavy Water Production Plant |publisher=globalsecurity.org |date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2006, Iranian President [[Ahmadinejad]] inaugurated the expansion of the country's heavy-water plant.

The core of the IR-40 is supposed to be re-designed based on the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear agreement]] in July 2015.

Iran is currently allowed to store only 130 Tons of heavy-water.

===Pakistan===
The 50 MWt heavy water and natural uranium research reactor at Khushab, in Punjab province, is a central element of Pakistan's program for production of plutonium, deuterium and tritium for advanced compact warheads (i.e. [[thermonuclear weapons]]). Pakistan succeeded in acquiring a tritium purification and storage plant and deuterium and tritium precursor materials from two German firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/facility/khushab.htm |title=Khushab Heavy Water Plant |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuterium oxide is used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] when using water as solvent if the [[nuclide]] of interest is hydrogen. This is because the signal from light-water (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) solvent molecules interfere with observing the signal from the molecule of interest dissolved in it. Deuterium has a different [[magnetic moment]] and therefore does not contribute to the [[H-1 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR]] signal at the hydrogen-1 resonance frequency.

For some experiments, it may be desirable to identify the labile hydrogens on a compound, that is hydrogens that can easily exchange away as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions on some positions in a molecule.  With addition of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, sometimes referred to as a ''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O shake'', labile hydrogens exchange away and are substituted by deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) atoms. These positions in the molecule then do not appear in the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectrum.

===Organic chemistry===
Deuterium oxide is often used as the source of deuterium for preparing specifically labelled [[isotopologue]]s of organic compounds. For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. [[Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide]], made from [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] and [[methyl iodide]] can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, both deuterium labelled. In cases where specific double labelling by deuterium and tritium is contemplated, the researcher must be aware that deuterium oxide, depending upon age and origin, can contain some tritium.

===Fourier transform spectroscopy===
Deuterium oxide is often used instead of water when collecting [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|FTIR]] spectra of proteins in solution. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O creates a strong band that overlaps with the [[amide]] I region of proteins. The band from D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is shifted away from the amide I region.

===Neutron moderator===
Heavy water is used in certain types of [[nuclear reactors]], where it acts as a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down neutrons so that they are more likely to react with the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] than with [[uranium-238]], which captures neutrons without fissioning.
The CANDU reactor uses this design. Light water also acts as a moderator,  but because light water absorbs more [[neutron]]s than heavy water, reactors using light water for a reactor moderator must use [[enriched uranium]] rather than natural uranium, otherwise [[Critical mass|criticality]] is impossible. A significant fraction of outdated power reactors, such as the [[RBMK]] reactors in the USSR, were constructed using normal water for cooling but [[graphite moderated reactor|graphite as a moderator]]. However, the danger of graphite in power reactors (graphite fires in part led to the [[Chernobyl disaster]]) has led to the discontinuation of graphite in standard reactor designs.

Because they do not require [[uranium enrichment]], [[heavy water reactor]]s are more of a concern in regards to [[nuclear proliferation]]. The breeding and extraction of plutonium can be a relatively rapid and cheap route to building a [[nuclear weapon]], as chemical separation of plutonium from fuel is easier than [[isotopic separation]] of U-235 from natural uranium.
Among current and past [[nuclear weapons states]], Israel, India, and North Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TRS407_scr/D407_scr1.pdf|title=HEAVY WATER REACTORS:
STATUS AND PROJECTED
DEVELOPMENT|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; first used plutonium from heavy water moderated reactors burning [[natural uranium]], while China, South Africa and Pakistan first built weapons using [[highly enriched uranium]].

In the U.S., however, the first experimental atomic reactor (1942), as well as the [[Manhattan Project]] Hanford production reactors that produced the plutonium for the [[Trinity test]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs, all used pure carbon (graphite) neutron moderators combined with normal water cooling pipes. They functioned with neither enriched uranium nor heavy water. Russian and British plutonium production also used graphite-moderated reactors.

There is no evidence that civilian heavy water power reactors—such as the CANDU or [[Atucha I nuclear power plant|Atucha]] designs—have been used to produce military fissile materials. In nations that do not already possess nuclear weapons, nuclear material at these facilities is under [[IAEA]] safeguards to discourage any diversion.

Due to its potential for use in [[nuclear weapon]]s programs, the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of heavy water are subject to government control in several countries. Suppliers of heavy water and heavy water production technology typically apply [[IAEA]] (International Atomic Energy Agency) administered safeguards and material accounting to heavy water. (In Australia, the ''Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987''.) In the U.S. and Canada, non-industrial quantities of heavy water (i.e., in the gram to kg range) are routinely available without special license through chemical supply dealers and commercial companies such as the world's former major producer [[Ontario Hydro]].

===Neutrino detector===
The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]] used 1,000 tonnes of heavy water on loan from [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]]. The [[neutrino detector]] is {{convert|6800|ft|m}} underground in a mine, to shield it from [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]]s. SNO was built to answer the question of whether or not electron-type [[neutrino]]s produced by fusion in the [[Sun]] (the only type the Sun should be producing directly, according to theory) might be able to turn into other types of neutrinos on the way to Earth. SNO detects the [[Cherenkov radiation]] in the water from high-energy electrons produced from electron-type [[neutrino]]s as they undergo charged current (CC) interactions with [[neutron]]s in [[deuterium]], turning them into protons and electrons (however, only the electrons are fast enough to produce Cherenkov radiation for detection). SNO also detects neutrino↔electron scattering (ES) events, where the neutrino transfers energy to the electron, which then proceeds to generate Cherenkov radiation distinguishable from that produced by CC events. The first of these two reactions is produced only by electron-type neutrinos, while the second can be caused by all of the neutrino flavors. The use of deuterium is critical to the SNO function, because all three &quot;flavours&quot; (types) of neutrinos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/sno2.html |title=The SNO Detector |publisher=The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Institute, Queen's University at Kingston |accessdate=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be detected in a third type of reaction as well, neutrino-disintegration, in which a neutrino of any type (electron, muon, or tau) scatters from a deuterium nucleus ([[deuteron]]), transferring enough energy to break up the loosely bound deuteron into a free [[neutron]] and [[proton]] via a neutral current (NC) interaction. This event is detected when the free neutron is absorbed by &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; present from NaCl deliberately dissolved in the heavy water, causing emission of characteristic capture gamma rays. Thus, in this experiment, heavy water not only provides the transparent medium necessary to produce and visualize Cherenkov radiation, but it also provides deuterium to detect exotic mu type (μ) and tau (τ) neutrinos, as well as a non-absorbent moderator medium to preserve free neutrons from this reaction, until they can be absorbed by an easily detected neutron-activated isotope.

===Metabolic rate testing in physiology and biology===
{{main article|Doubly labeled water test}}
Heavy water is employed as part of a mixture with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O for a common and safe test of mean metabolic rate in humans and animals undergoing their normal activities.

===Tritium production===
{{See also|Tritium#Deuterium}}
[[Tritium]] is the active substance in [[tritium illumination|self-powered lighting]] and controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including [[autoradiography]] and [[radioactive label]]ing. It is also used in [[nuclear weapon design]] for [[boosted fission weapon]]s and [[tritium#Neutron initiator|initiators]]. Some tritium is created in [[heavy water moderated reactor]]s when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small [[Neutron cross-section|cross-section]] (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape.

Producing a lot of tritium in this way would require reactors with very high neutron fluxes, or with a very high proportion of heavy water to [[nuclear fuel]] and very low [[neutron absorption]] by other reactor material. The tritium would then have to be recovered by [[isotope separation]] from a much larger quantity of deuterium, unlike production from [[lithium-6]] (the present method), where only chemical separation is needed.

Deuterium's absorption cross section for [[thermal neutron]]s is 0.52 milli[[barn (unit)|barns]] (5.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 1 barn = 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while those of [[oxygen-16]] and [[oxygen-17]] are 0.19 and 0.24 millibarns, respectively. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O makes up 0.038% of natural [[oxygen]], making the overall cross section 0.28 millibarns. Therefore, in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with natural oxygen, 21% of [[neutron capture]]s are on oxygen, rising higher as &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O builds up from neutron capture on &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O. Also, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O may emit an [[alpha particle]] on neutron capture, producing radioactive [[carbon-14]].

{{History of science}}
The '''history of Science and Technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it (technology) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, &quot;History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940,&quot; ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

{{String theory|related}}

The '''holographic principle''' is a principle of [[string theory|string theories]] and a supposed property of [[quantum gravity]] that states that the description of a volume of [[space]] can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] to the region—preferably a [[light-like]] boundary like a [[apparent horizon|gravitational horizon]]. First proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]], it was given a precise string-theory interpretation by [[Leonard Susskind]]&lt;ref name=SusskindArXiv&gt;{{cite journal |title=The World as a Hologram |last=Susskind |first=Leonard |doi=10.1063/1.531249 |date=1995 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=6377–6396|arxiv=hep-th/9409089 |bibcode = 1995JMP....36.6377S }}&lt;/ref&gt; who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and [[Charles Thorn]].&lt;ref name=SusskindArXiv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Charles B. |last=Thorn |title=Reformulating string theory with the 1/N expansion |conference=International A.D.

In a larger sense, the theory suggests that the entire [[universe]] can be seen as [[dimension|two-dimensional]] information on the [[cosmological horizon]], the event horizon from which information may still be gathered and not lost due to the natural limitations of spacetime supporting a black hole, an observer and a given setting of these specific elements,{{clarify|event horizon or gravitational horizon?|date=November 2014}} such that the [[three dimensions]] we observe are an effective description only at [[macroscopic scale]]s and at [[high-energy physics|low energies]]. Cosmological holography has not been made mathematically precise, partly because the [[particle horizon]] has a non-zero area and grows with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computational Capacity of the Universe|date=2002-05-24|first=Seth|last=Lloyd|issue=23|page=237901|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=88|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.237901|pmid=12059399|bibcode=2002PhRvL..88w7901L|arxiv = quant-ph/0110141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=holographic+everything+site%3Actnsstars.org |title=Multiverse Cosmological Models and the Anthropic Principle |accessdate=2008-03-14 |last=Davies |first=Paul |work=CTNS }}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holographic principle was inspired by [[black hole thermodynamics]], which conjectures that the maximal [[entropy]] in any region scales with the radius ''squared'', and not cubed as might be expected. In the case of a [[black hole]], the insight was that the informational content of all the objects that have fallen into the hole might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon. The holographic principle resolves the [[black hole information paradox]] within the framework of string theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Susskind |first=L. |title=The Black Hole War – My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |date=2008}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there exist classical solutions to the Einstein equations that allow values of the entropy larger than those allowed by an area law, hence in principle larger than those of a black hole. These are the so-called &quot;Wheeler's bags of gold&quot;. The existence of such solutions conflicts with the holographic interpretation, and their effects in a quantum theory of gravity including the holographic principle are not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name=Marolf01a&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Marolf |authorlink=Donald Marolf |title=Black Holes, AdS, and CFTs |date=April 2009 |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=903–17 |doi=10.1007/s10714-008-0749-7 |bibcode=2009GReGr..41..903M|arxiv = 0810.4886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black hole entropy==
{{Main article|Black hole thermodynamics}}
An object with relatively high [[entropy]] is microscopically random, like a hot gas. A known configuration of classical fields has zero entropy: there is nothing random about [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, or [[gravitational wave]]s. Since black holes are exact solutions of [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's equations]], they were thought not to have any entropy either.

But [[Jacob Bekenstein]] noted that this leads to a violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. If one throws a hot gas with entropy into a black hole, once it crosses the [[event horizon]], the entropy would disappear. The random properties of the gas would no longer be seen once the black hole had absorbed the gas and settled down. One way of salvaging the second law is if black holes are in fact random objects with an [[entropy]] that increases by an amount greater than the entropy of the consumed gas.

Bekenstein assumed that black holes are maximum entropy objects—that they have more entropy than anything else in the same volume. In a sphere of radius ''R'', the entropy in a relativistic gas increases as the energy increases. The only known limit is [[gravitation]]al; when there is too much energy [entropy?] the gas collapses into a black hole. Bekenstein used &lt;!-- Redshift~golden number~greenshift  --&gt;this to put an [[Bekenstein bound|upper bound]] on the entropy in a region of space, and the bound was proportional to the area of the region. He concluded that the black hole entropy is directly proportional to the area of the [[event horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacob D. |last=Bekenstein |title=Universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for bounded systems |journal=Physical Review D |volume=23 |issue=215 |pages=287–298 |date=January 1981 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.23.287 |bibcode = 1981PhRvD..23..287B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Hawking]] had shown earlier that the total horizon area of a collection of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like [[geodesics]]; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of [[black hole thermodynamics]], by analogy with the [[Second law of thermodynamics|law of entropy increase]], but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.

Hawking knew that if the horizon area were an actual entropy, black holes would have to radiate. When heat is added to a thermal system, the change in entropy is the increase in [[mass-energy]] divided by temperature:
::&lt;math&gt;
{\rm d}S = \frac{{\rm\delta }M \ c^2}{T}.
&lt;/math&gt;
(Here  the term ''&amp;delta;M&amp;nbsp;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is  substituted for  the thermal energy added to the system, generally by non-integrable random processes, in contrast to d''S'', which is a function of a few &quot;state variables&quot; only,  i.e. in conventional thermodynamics only of the  [[Kelvin]] temperature ''T'' and a few additional state variables as, e.g., the pressure)

If black holes have a finite entropy, they should also have a finite temperature. In particular, they would come to equilibrium with a thermal gas of photons. This means that black holes would not only absorb photons, but they would also have to emit them in the right amount to maintain [[detailed balance]].

Time independent solutions to field equations do not emit radiation, because a time independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking set out to show that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that [[Hawking radiation|they do]], and in just the right way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Parthasarathi | last = Majumdar | title = Black Hole Entropy and Quantum Gravity | arxiv = gr-qc/9807045 | journal =   | date = 1998|bibcode = 1999InJPB..73..147M | volume = 73 |page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entropy is proportional to the [[logarithm]] of the number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]], the ways a system can be configured microscopically while leaving the macroscopic description unchanged. Black hole entropy is deeply puzzling — it says that the logarithm of the number of states of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon, not the volume in the interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciam2003&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | first = Jacob D. | last = Bekenstein | authorlink = Jacob Bekenstein | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleid=000AF072-4891-1F0A-97AE80A84189EEDF | title = Information in the Holographic Universe — Theoretical results about black holes suggest that the universe could be like a gigantic hologram |magazine= [[Scientific American]] |date=August 2003 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black hole information paradox==
{{Main article|Black hole information paradox}}
Hawking's calculation suggested that the radiation which black holes emit is not related in any way to the matter that they absorb. The outgoing light rays start exactly at the edge of the black hole and spend a long time near the horizon, while the infalling matter only reaches the horizon much later.  The infalling and outgoing mass/energy only interact when they cross. It is implausible that the outgoing state would be completely determined by some tiny residual scattering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_2R_jY2KiEC&amp;pg=PA512&amp;lpg=PA512&amp;dq=It+is+implausible+that+the+outgoing+state+would+be+completely+determined+by+some+tiny+residual+scattering.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7URLWy6ET&amp;sig=CQ0qgnwG8EUg5YE9TIx-B_0hvoM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO-tzEu7vRAhXIKCYKHdUuCScQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20is%20implausible%20that%20the%20outgoing%20state%20would%20be%20completely%20determined%20by%20some%20tiny%20residual%20scattering.&amp;f=false|title=Superstrings, P-branes and M-theory|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawking interpreted this to mean that when black holes absorb some photons in a pure state described by a [[wave function]], they re-emit new [[photons]] in a thermal mixed state described by a [[density matrix]]. This would mean that quantum mechanics would have to be modified because, in quantum mechanics, states which are superpositions with probability amplitudes never become states which are probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities.&lt;ref group=note&gt;except in the case of measurements, which the black hole should not be performing&lt;/ref&gt;

Troubled by this paradox, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] analyzed the emission of [[Hawking radiation]] in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE-yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=Troubled+by+this+paradox,+Gerard+'t+Hooft+analyzed+the+emission+of+Hawking+radiation+in+more+detai&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fJw-sO_1Sa&amp;sig=CFFXYxC2TkQ-9CiS2ZvQ8NGtPPc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivu_Tpu7vRAhVLciYKHVQxBFoQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Troubled%20by%20this%20paradox,%20Gerard%20't%20Hooft%20analyzed%20the%20emission%20of%20Hawking%20radiation%20in%20more%20detai&amp;f=false|title=The Cosmic Compendium: Black Holes|last=Anderson|first=Rupert W.|date=2015-03-31|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329024588|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, there is a way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their [[gravitational field]] would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and like a shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory [[Worldsheet|world sheet]]. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.

This idea was made more precise by Leonard Susskind, who had also been developing holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of the horizon of a black hole is a complete description{{refn|&quot;Complete description&quot; means all the ''primary'' qualities.  For example, [[John Locke]] (and before him [[Robert Boyle]]) determined these to be ''size, shape, motion, number, ''and'' solidity''. Such ''secondary quality'' information as ''color, aroma, taste ''and'' sound'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|title=[[Consciousness Explained]]|date=1991|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York|isbn=0-316-18066-1|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; or internal quantum state is not information that is implied to be preserved in the surface fluctuations of the event horizon. (See however &quot;path integral quantization&quot;)|group=note}} of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory was just such a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.

This work showed that the black hole information paradox is resolved when quantum gravity is described in an unusual string-theoretic way assuming the string-theoretical description is complete, unambiguous and non-redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv| first = L. | last = Susskind  |arxiv=hep-th/0302219 |title = The Anthropic landscape of string theory  |date= February 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The space-time in quantum gravity would emerge as an effective description of the theory of oscillations of a lower-dimensional black-hole horizon, and suggest that any black hole with appropriate properties, not just strings, would serve as a basis for a description of string theory.

In 1995, Susskind, along with collaborators [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], and [[Stephen Shenker]], presented a formulation of the new [[M-theory]] using a holographic description in terms of charged point black holes, the D0 [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]]s of [[Type II string theory|type IIA string theory]]. The matrix theory they proposed was first suggested as a description of two branes in 11-dimensional [[supergravity]] by [[Bernard de Wit]], [[Jens Hoppe]], and [[Hermann Nicolai]]. The later authors reinterpreted the same matrix models as a description of the dynamics of point black holes in particular limits. Holography allowed them to conclude that the dynamics of these black holes give a complete [[non-perturbative]] formulation of M-theory. In 1997, [[Juan Maldacena]] gave the first holographic descriptions of a higher-dimensional object, the 3+1-dimensional [[Type II string theory|type IIB]] [[Membrane (M-theory)|membrane]], which resolved a long-standing problem of finding a string description which describes a [[gauge theory]]. These developments simultaneously explained how string theory is related to some forms of supersymmetric quantum field theories.

==Limit on information density==

Entropy, if considered as information (see [[information entropy]]), is measured in [[bit]]s. The total quantity of bits is related to the total [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of matter/energy.

For a given energy in a given volume, there is an upper limit to the density of information (the [[Bekenstein bound]]) about the whereabouts of all the particles which compose matter in that volume, suggesting that matter itself cannot be subdivided infinitely many times and there must be an ultimate level of [[elementary particle|fundamental particles]]. As the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of a particle are the product of all the degrees of freedom of its sub-particles, were a particle to have infinite subdivisions into lower-level particles, the degrees of freedom of the original particle would be infinite, violating the maximal limit of entropy density. The holographic principle thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level, and that the fundamental particle is a bit (1 or 0) of information.

The most rigorous realization of the holographic principle is the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] by [[Juan Maldacena]]. However, J.D. Brown and [[Marc Henneaux]] had rigorously proved already in 1986, that the asymptotic symmetry of 2+1 dimensional gravity gives rise to a [[Virasoro algebra]], whose corresponding quantum theory is a 2-dimensional conformal field theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=J.

==High-level summary==

The physical universe is widely seen to be composed of &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;. In his 2003 article published in [[Scientific American]] magazine, [[Jacob Bekenstein]] speculatively summarized a current trend started by [[John Archibald Wheeler]], which suggests scientists may ''&quot;regard the physical world as made of [[information]], with energy and matter as incidentals.&quot;'' Bekenstein asks &quot;Could we, as [[William Blake]] memorably penned, 'see a world in a grain of sand,' or is that idea no more than '[[poetic license]],'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/information-in-the-hologr-2003-08 Information in the Holographic Universe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the holographic principle.

===Unexpected connection===

Bekenstein's topical overview &quot;A Tale of Two Entropies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:E360V697cvgJ:ref-sciam.livejournal.com/1190.html&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=1{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes potentially profound implications of Wheeler's trend, in part by noting a previously unexpected connection between the world of [[information theory]] and classical physics. This connection was first described shortly after the seminal 1948 papers of American applied mathematician [[Claude E. Shannon]] introduced today's most widely used measure of information content, now known as [[Shannon entropy]]. As an objective measure of the quantity of information, Shannon entropy has been enormously useful, as the design of all modern communications and data storage devices, from cellular phones to [[modems]] to hard disk drives and [[DVD]]s, rely on Shannon entropy.

In [[thermodynamics]] (the branch of physics dealing with heat), entropy is popularly described as a measure of the &quot;[[Order and disorder (physics)|disorder]]&quot; in a physical system of matter and energy. In 1877 Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] described it more precisely in terms of the ''number of distinct microscopic states'' that the particles composing a macroscopic &quot;chunk&quot; of matter could be in, while still ''looking'' like the same macroscopic &quot;chunk&quot;. As an example, for the air in a room, its thermodynamic entropy would equal the logarithm of the count of all the ways that the individual gas molecules could be distributed in the room, and all the ways they could be moving.

===Energy, matter, and information equivalence===

Shannon's efforts to find a way to quantify the information contained in, for example, a telegraph message, led him unexpectedly to a formula with the same form as [[Boltzmann's entropy formula|Boltzmann's]]. In an article in the August 2003 issue of Scientific American titled &quot;Information in the Holographic Universe&quot;, Bekenstein summarizes that ''&quot;Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent: the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement...&quot;'' of matter and energy. The only salient difference between the thermodynamic entropy of physics and Shannon's entropy of information is in the units of measure; the former is expressed in units of energy divided by temperature, the latter in ''essentially dimensionless'' &quot;bits&quot; of information.

The holographic principle states that the entropy of ''ordinary mass'' (not just black holes) is also proportional to surface area and not volume; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a [[hologram]] which is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the information &quot;inscribed&quot; on the surface of its boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciam2003&quot;/&gt;

==Experimental tests==
The [[Fermilab]] physicist [[Craig Hogan]] claims that the holographic principle would imply quantum fluctuations in spatial position&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hogan |first=Craig J. |date=2008 |title=Measurement of quantum fluctuations in geometry |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |page=104031 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.77.104031 |arxiv=0712.3419 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |bibcode = 2008PhRvD..77j4031H }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that would lead to apparent background noise or &quot;holographic noise&quot; measurable at gravitational wave detectors, in particular [[GEO 600]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Chown|first=Marcus|title=Our world may be a giant hologram|newspaper=NewScientist|date=15 January 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300|accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these claims have not been widely accepted, or cited, among quantum gravity researchers and appear to be in direct conflict with string theory calculations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Consequently, he ends up with inequalities of the type... Except that one may look at the actual equations of Matrix theory and see that none of these commutators is nonzero... The last displayed inequality above obviously can't be a consequence of quantum gravity because it doesn't depend on G at all! However, in the G→0 limit, one must reproduce non-gravitational physics in the flat Euclidean background spacetime. Hogan's rules don't have the right limit so they can't be right.&quot; – [[Lubos Motl]], [http://motls.blogspot.com/2012/02/hogans-holographic-noise-doesnt-exist.html Hogan's holographic noise doesn't exist], Feb 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyses in 2011 of measurements of gamma ray burst [[GRB 041219A]] in 2004 by the [[INTEGRAL]] space observatory launched in 2002 by the [[European Space Agency]] shows that Craig Hogan's noise is absent down to a scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;−48&lt;/sup&gt; meters, as opposed to scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt; meters predicted by Hogan, and the scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; meters found in measurements of the [[GEO 600]] instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Integral_challenges_physics_beyond_Einstein|title=Integral challenges physics beyond Einstein|date=30 June 2011|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research continues at Fermilab under Hogan as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holometer.fnal.gov/faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions for the Holometer at Fermilab|date=6 July 2013|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Bekenstein]] also claimed to have found a way to test the holographic principle with a tabletop photon experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/single-photon-could-detect-quantum-scale-black-holes-1.11871|title=Single photon could detect quantum-scale black holes|last=Cowen|first=Ron|date=22 November 2012|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Juan Martín Maldacena]] published a seminal and highly cited paper on a conjectured relation between these different fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Juan Martin Maldacena|year=1998 |title=The Large N Limit of Superconformal Field Theories and Supergravity|arxiv=hep-th/9711200 |journal=Adv.

One paper computes the internal energy of a black hole, the position of its event horizon, its entropy and other properties based on the predictions of string theory and the effects of [[virtual particle]]s. The other paper calculates the internal energy of the corresponding lower-dimensional cosmos with no gravity.

The two last-mentioned simulations match. However, the papers are not an actual proof of Maldacena's conjecture for all cases but a demonstration that the conjecture works for a particular theoretical case, verifying the AdS/CFT correspondence for a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New work gives credence to theory of universe as a hologram |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-12-credence-theory-universe-hologram.html |date=December 13, 2013 |first=Bob |last=Yirka |publisher=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Hamilton, Ontario}}
[[File:UnitedEmpireLoyalistsHamilton.JPG|left|thumb|[[United Empire Loyalists]]]]
In pre-[[New France|colonial]] times, the [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Indians]] used much of the land but were gradually driven out by the [[Iroquois|Five (later Six) Nations]] (Iroquois) who were allied with the [[Canada under British Imperial control (1764-1867)|British]] against the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and their French allies. A member of the Iroquois Confederacy provided the route and name for [[Mohawk Road (Hamilton, Ontario)|Mohawk Road]], which originally included King Street in the lower city.

Following the United States gaining independence after their American Revolutionary War, in 1784, about 10,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] settled in [[Upper Canada]] (what is now southern Ontario), chiefly in [[Regional Municipality of Niagara, Ontario|Niagara]], around the [[Bay of Quinte]], and along the [[St. Lawrence River]] between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Montreal]]. The Crown granted them land in these areas in order to develop Upper Canada and to compensate them for losses in the United States. With former First Nations lands available for purchase, these new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans, attracted by the availability of inexpensive, arable land. At the same time, large numbers of [[Iroquois]] who had been allied with Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the United States.&lt;ref name=LOYALISTS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uelac.org/PDF/loyalist.pdf |title=A Short History of the United Empire Loyalists |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |last=Mackenzie |first=Ann| format=PDF| publisher=United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Hamilton was conceived by [[George Hamilton (politician)|George Hamilton]] (a son of a [[Queenston]] entrepreneur and founder, [[Robert Hamilton (1753-1809)|Robert Hamilton]]), when he purchased farm holdings of [[James Durand]], the local Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|British Legislative Assembly]], shortly after the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WEAVER1985&quot;/&gt; [[Nathaniel Hughson]], a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at [[York, Upper Canada|York]] during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore District]], of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;WEAVER1985&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- This citation applies to the paragraph in entirety --&gt;

Initially, this town was not the most important centre of the Gore District. An early indication of Hamilton’s sudden prosperity was signaled by the fact that in 1816 it was chosen over [[Ancaster, Ontario]] that year to be the administrative center for the new Gore District. Another dramatic economic turnabout for Hamilton occurred in 1832 when a canal was finally cut through the outer sand bar that enabled Hamilton to become a major port.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin and Development of the Road Network of the Niagara Peninsula, Ontario 1770-1851''; Andrew F.Burghardt; McMaster University 1969&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832, when a cut-stone design was completed on Prince's Square, one of the two squares created in 1816.&lt;ref name=&quot;WEAVER1985&quot;/&gt; Subsequently, the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13, 1833.&lt;ref&gt;''Statutes of Upper Canada, 1833'', 3° William IV, pg.&amp;nbsp;58–68. Chapter XVII An act to define the Limits of the Town of Hamilton, in the District of Gore, and to establish a Police and Public Market therein.&lt;/ref&gt; Official city status was achieved on June 9, 1846, by an act of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], 9 Victoria Chapter 73.&lt;ref name=1846est&gt;''Provincial Statutes of Canada'', 1846, 9° vict. pg 981 Chapter LXXIII.

By 1845, the population was 6,475. In 1846, there were useful roads to many communities as well as stage coaches and steamboats to Toronto, Queenston, and Niagara. Eleven cargo schooners were owned in Hamilton. Eleven churches were in operation. A reading room provided access to newspapers from other cities and from England and the U.S. In addition to stores of all types, four banks, tradesmen of various types, and sixty-five taverns, industry in the community included three breweries, ten importers of dry goods and groceries, five importers of hardware, two tanneries, three coachmakers, and a marble and a stone works.

As the city grew, several prominent buildings were constructed in the late 19th century, including the [[Grand Lodge of Canada]] in 1855,&lt;ref name=GRANDLODGE&gt;

Though suffering through the [[Hamilton Street Railway]] strike of 1906, with industrial businesses expanding, Hamilton's population doubled between 1900 and 1914. Two steel manufacturing companies, [[Stelco]] and [[Dofasco]], were formed in 1910 and 1912, respectively. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and the [[Beech-Nut|Beech-Nut Packing Company]] opened manufacturing plants in 1914 and 1922, respectively, their first outside the US.&lt;ref name=HISINDI&gt;

In 1929 the city's first high-rise building, the Pigott Building, was constructed; that year [[McMaster University]] moved from Toronto to Hamilton, in 1934 the second [[Canadian Tire]] store in Canada opened here; in 1940 the airport was completed; and in 1948, the [[Studebaker Canada Ltd.|Studebaker]] assembly line was constructed.&lt;ref name=memproj45&gt;{{cite press release| title =The Hamilton Memory Project; STUDEBAKER| publisher =The Hamilton Spectator–Souvenir Edition|page= MP45| date = June 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure and retail development continued, with the [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway opening in 1958, and the first [[Tim Hortons]] store in 1964.

Since then, many of the large industries have moved or shut down operations in restructuring that also affected the United States.&lt;ref name=HISINDI/&gt; The economy has shifted more toward the service sector, such as transportation, education, and health services.

On January 1, 2001, the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of Hamilton and its five neighbouring municipalities: [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]], [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]], [[Glanbrook, Ontario|Glanbrook]], and [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]].&lt;ref name=amalgprovles/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=headlake/&gt; --&gt; Before amalgamation, the &quot;old&quot; City of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods. The former region of Hamilton-Wentworth had a population of 490,268. The amalgamation created a single-tier municipal government ending subsidization of its suburbs. The new amalgamated city has 519,949 people in more than 100 neighbourhoods, and surrounding communities.&lt;ref name=FOOTSTEPS&gt;{{cite book|title=Footsteps in Time: Exploring Hamilton's heritage neighbourhoods|first=Bill |last=Manson |publisher=North Shore Publishing Inc|year=2003|isbn=1-896899-22-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 there was a devastating fire at the Plastimet plastics plant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/plastimetincfire00sochuoft/plastimetincfire00sochuoft_djvu.txt Full text of &quot;Plastimet Inc. fire Hamilton, Ontario: July 9-12, 1997 /&quot;].

{{See also|Transportation in Hamilton, Ontario|List of streets in Hamilton, Ontario}}

Hamilton is located in [[Southern Ontario]] on the western end of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and wraps around the westernmost part of [[Lake Ontario]]; most of the city, including the downtown section, is on the south shore. Hamilton is situated in the geographic centre of the [[Golden Horseshoe]] and is roughly the midway point between [[Toronto]] and [[Buffalo, New York]], although slightly closer to the former. Its major physical features are Hamilton Harbour, marking the northern limit of the city, and the [[Niagara Escarpment]] running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth, bisecting the city into &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; parts. The maximum high point is 250m (820') above the level of Lake Ontario.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web

[[Hamilton Harbour]] is a natural harbour with a large [[sandbar]] called the Beachstrip. This sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment. Hamilton's deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbour and is traversed by two bridges, the QEW's [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]] and the lower Canal Lift Bridge.&lt;ref name=Bay&gt;{{cite web

Between 1788 and 1793, the townships at the Head-of-the-Lake were surveyed and named. The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario.&lt;ref name=headlake/&gt; [[John Ryckman]], born in Barton township (where present day downtown Hamilton is), described the area in 1803 as he remembered it: &quot;The city in 1803 was all forest. The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick, almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth&amp;nbsp;... Bears ate pigs, so settlers warred on bears. Wolves gobbled sheep and geese, so they hunted and trapped wolves. They also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside. There was plenty of game. Many a time have I seen (sic) a deer jump the fence into my back yard, and there were millions of pigeons which we clubbed as they flew low.&quot;&lt;ref name=barton2&gt;{{cite web

[[George Hamilton (politician)|George Hamilton]], a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in 1815. He kept several east–west roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north–south streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated &quot;East&quot; or &quot;West&quot; if they crossed [[James Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|James Street]] or Highway 6. Streets were designated &quot;North&quot; or &quot;South&quot; if they crossed [[King Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|King Street]] or Highway 8.&lt;ref name=HAMBIO1&gt;{{cite book

  |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall design of the townsite, likely conceived in 1816, was commonplace. George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in [[Upper Canada]] and throughout the American frontier. The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane. It took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold, but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823, and a new court-house in 1827 encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828–9. At this time, he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands, but the natural growth of the town was to the north of Hamilton's plot.&lt;ref name=Hamilton2&gt;{{cite web

===Climate===
Hamilton's climate is humid-continental, characterized by changeable weather patterns. However, its climate is moderate compared with most of Canada. Hamilton's location on an embayment at the southwestern corner of Lake Ontario with an escarpment dividing upper and lower parts of the city results in noticeable disparities in weather over short distances. This is also the case with pollution levels, which depending on localized winds patterns or low clouds can be high in certain areas mostly originating from the city's steel industry mixed with regional vehicle pollution. With a July average of exactly {{convert|22.0|C|1}},&lt;ref name = RBGstats /&gt; the lower city is located in a pocket of the [[Humid continental climate#Dfa/Dwa/Dsa: Hot (or very warm) summer subtype|''Dfa'' climate zone]] found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario (between Hamilton and Toronto and eastward into the [[Niagara Peninsula]]), while the upper reaches of the city fall into the [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|''Dfb'' climate zone]].

The airport's open, rural location and higher altitude (240m vs. 85m ASL downtown) results in lower temperatures, generally windier conditions, and higher snowfall amounts than lower, built-up areas of the city. One exception is on early spring afternoons; when colder than air lake temperatures keep shoreline areas significantly cooler, under the presence of an east or north-east onshore flow.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Hamilton was 41.1&amp;nbsp;°C (106&amp;nbsp;°F) on 14 July 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton (July 1868)&quot;&gt;

According to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian Census]], more than 20 percent of the local population was [[Immigration to Canada|not born in Canada]]. This is the third highest such proportion in Canada after [[Toronto]] at 49%, and [[Vancouver]] at 39%. Between 2001 and 2006, the foreign-born population increased by 7.7% while the total population of the Hamilton census metropolitan area (CMA) grew by 4.3%. The share of Canada's recent immigrants who settle in Hamilton has remained unchanged since 2001 at 1.9%. Hamilton was home to 20,800 immigrants who arrived in Canada between 2001 and 2006, half of whom were born in [[Canadians of Asian ancestry|Asia]] and the Middle East, while nearly one-quarter (23%) were from Europe. Hamilton also had a high proportion of people with [[Italians|Italian]], [[English Canadian|English]], [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]], [[German Canadian|German]] and [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] ancestry. Nearly three in ten residents reported English as their sole ethnic origin or as one of their ancestral origins.

Hamilton also has a large French community for which provincial services are offered in French. In Ontario, urban centres where there are at least 5000 Francophones or where at least 10% of the population is francophone are designated areas where bilingual provincial services have to be offered. According to the latest statistics, the Francophone community grew by 50% between 2006 and 2011 in Hamilton, and in the city, 45,000 citizens claim to have knowledge of both official languages, amongst which 13,000 have French as a mother tongue. The Franco-Ontarian community of Hamilton boasts two school boards (Conseil scolaire Viamonde and Conseil scolaire catholique Mon-Avenir) five schools (2 secondary and 3 elementary), a community health centre that is part of the LHIN (Centre de santé communautaire Hamilton/Niagara), a cultural centre (Centre français Hamilton), three daycare centres, a provincially funded employment centre (Options Emploi), a community college site (Collège Boréal) and a community organization that supports the development of the francophone community in Hamilton (ACFO Régionale Hamilton).

Originally, in the 1940s, the [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] was used as a wartime air force training station. Today TradePort International Corporation manages and operates the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. Under TradePort management, passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has increased from 90,000 in 1996 to approximately 900,000 in 2002. The airport's mid-term target for growth in its passenger service is five million air travelers annually. The air cargo sector of the airport has 24–7 operational capability and strategic geographic location, allowing its capacity to increase by 50% since 1996; 91,000&amp;nbsp;[[metric tonnes]] (100,000&amp;nbsp;[[Short ton|tons]]) of cargo passed through the airport in 2002.

The airport is also home to the [[Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum]].

A report by Hemson Consulting identified an opportunity to develop {{convert|1000|ha|acre|-2|}} of greenfields (the size of the Royal Botanical Gardens) that could generate an estimated 90,000 jobs by 2031.

[[File:Husité - Jenský kodex.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of battle between mounted knights|Battle between Hussites and [[crusade]]rs; Jena Codex, 15th century]]
The '''Hussites''' ({{lang-cs|Husité}} or ''Kališníci''; &quot;Chalice People&quot;) were a pre-[[Protestant]] [[Christian movement]] which began in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and followed the teachings of Czech reformer [[Jan Hus]], who became the best known representative of the [[Bohemian Reformation]].

Hussites emerged as majority [[Utraquist]] with a significant [[Taborite]] faction, and smaller regional ones that included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]] and Orphans. After the [[Council of Constance]] lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article &quot;Constance, Council of&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Hussites fought the [[Hussite Wars]] (1420–1434) for their religious and political cause. After the [[Hussite Wars]] ended, the [[Catholic]]-supported [[Utraquist]] side came out victorious from conflict with the [[Taborites]] and became the most common representation of the Hussite faith in Bohemia. Catholics and Utraquists were emancipated in Bohemia after the [[religious peace of Kutná Hora]] in 1485.

Hussites were one of the most important forerunners of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened [[Czechs|Czech]] national awareness. Hussitism spread from [[Bohemia]] into the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] that included [[Silesia]] and [[Moravia]]. [[Bohemia]], or what is now territory of the [[Czech Republic]], remained majority Hussite for two centuries until [[Roman Catholicism]] was reimposed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] after the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

Major Hussite theologians included [[Petr Chelcicky]], [[Jerome of Prague]], and others. A number of Czech national heroes were Hussite, including [[Jan Zizka]], who led a fierce resistance to five consecutive crusades proclaimed on Hussite Bohemia by the [[Papacy]].

Among present-day Christians, Hussite traditions are represented in the [[Moravian Church]], [[Unity of the Brethren]], and the refounded [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Czechoslovak Hussite]] churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nĕmec&quot;&gt;Nĕmec, Ludvík &quot;The Czechoslovak heresy and schism: the emergence of a national Czechoslovak church,&quot; American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1975, {{ISBN|0-87169-651-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Hus's death on Bohemia==
[[Image:Ussita pavese shield Prag Museum 1429.jpg|right|thumb|Recreation of Hussite shield from an original in the [[National Museum (Prague)|Museum of Prague]]]]
[[Image:Jagiełło dispute.JPG|right|thumb|Hussite theologians dispute in the presence of King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland]]

The arrest of Hus in 1414 caused considerable resentment in [[Czech lands]]. The authorities of both countries appealed urgently and repeatedly to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] to release Jan Hus.

When news of his death at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 arrived, disturbances broke out, directed primarily against the [[clergy]] and especially against the monks. Even the Archbishop narrowly escaped from the effects of this popular anger. The treatment of Hus was felt to be a disgrace inflicted upon the whole country and his death was seen as a criminal act. King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], prompted by his grudge against Sigismund, at first gave free vent to his indignation at the course of events in [[Constance]]. His wife openly favoured the friends of Hus. Avowed Hussites stood at the head of the government.

A league was formed by certain lords,{{Who|date=April 2011}} who pledged themselves to protect the free preaching of the Gospel upon all their possessions and estates and to obey the power of the Bishops only where their orders accorded with the injunctions of the [[Bible]]. The university would arbitrate any disputed points. The entire Hussite nobility joined the league. Other than verbal protest of the council's treatment of Hus, there was little evidence of any actions taken by the nobility until 1417. At that point several of the lesser nobility and some barons, signatories of the 1415 protest letter, removed Romanist priests from their parishes, replacing them with priests willing to give communion in both wine and bread. The chalice of wine became the central identifying symbol of the Hussite movement.&lt;ref&gt;John Klassen, The Nobility and the Making of the Hussite Revolution(East European Quarterly/Columbia University Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; If the king had joined, its resolutions would have received the sanction of the law; but he refused, and approached the newly formed Roman Catholic League of lords, whose members pledged themselves to support the king, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and the Council. The prospect of a civil war began to emerge.

[[Pope Martin V]] as Cardinal Otto of [[Colonna]] had attacked Hus with relentless severity. He energetically resumed the battle against Hus's teaching after the enactments of the [[Council of Constance]]. He wished to eradicate completely the doctrine of Hus, for which purpose the co-operation of King Wenceslaus had to be obtained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In 1418, Sigismund succeeded in winning his brother over to the standpoint of the council by pointing out the inevitability of a religious war if the [[Christian heresy|heretics]] in Bohemia found further protection.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Hussite statesmen and army leaders had to leave the country and Roman Catholic priests were reinstated. These measures caused a general commotion which hastened the death of King Wenceslaus by a paralytic stroke in 1419.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} His heir was Sigismund.

==The parties of the Bohemian Hussites==
Hussism organised itself during the years 1415–1419. From the beginning, there formed two parties, with a smaller number of people withdrawing from both parties around the pacifist [[Petr Chelčický]], whose teachings would form the foundation of the [[Unitas Fratrum]].

The moderate party, who followed Hus more closely, sought to conduct reform while leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched.

The more radical party{{clarify|date=May 2014}}&lt;!--Did this party have a name? If so, it would be good to use it here and elsewhere to keep all these parties clear in the (average) reader's mind. It's really not clear how many parties there were or what they were.--&gt; identified itself more boldly with the doctrines of [[John Wycliffe]], sharing his passionate hatred of the [[monasticism|monastic]] clergy, and his desire to return the Church to its supposed condition during the time of the apostles. This required the removal of the existing hierarchy and the secularisation of ecclesiastical possessions. The radicals preached the ''&quot;sufficientia legis Christi&quot;''—the divine law (i.e. the [[Bible]]) is the sole rule and canon for human society, not only in the church, but also in political and civil matters. They rejected therefore, as early as 1416, everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible, such as the [[veneration]] of saints and images, [[fasting|fasts]], superfluous holidays, the oath, intercession for the dead, auricular [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[indulgence]]s, the sacraments of [[Confirmation]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick]]; they admitted laymen and women{{citation needed|reason=women in preachers office|date=August 2015}} to the preacher's office, and chose their own priests. But above all they clung to Wycliffe's doctrine of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], denying [[transubstantiation]], and this is the principal point by which they are distinguished from the moderate party.

===Four Articles of Prague===
The programme of the more conservative Hussites (the moderate party)&lt;!--&quot;The moderate party&quot; was added to make it clear which of the two parties this was. If &quot;the more conservative Hussites&quot; was NOT the moderate party, then something needs to be made clearer.--&gt; is contained in the Four Articles of [[Prague]], which were written by Jakoubek ze Stříbra and agreed upon in July 1420, promulgated in the [[Latin]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and [[German language|German]] languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;global.britannica.com&quot;&gt;http://global.britannica.com/topic/Four-Articles-of-Prague&lt;/ref&gt; The full text is about two pages long, but they are often summarized as:&lt;ref name=&quot;global.britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

*Freedom to preach the word of God
*Celebration of the [[communion under both kinds]] (bread and wine to priests and  [[laity]] alike)
*Poverty of the clergy and expropriation of church property;
*Punishment for  [[mortal sins]] regardless of stature.

===Calixtines (or Utraquists) and Taborites===
The views of the moderate Hussites were widely represented at the University and among the citizens of Prague; they were therefore called the Prague Party, but also Calixtines (Latin ''calix'' chalice) or [[Utraquists]] (Latin ''utraque'' both), because they emphasized the second article of Prague, and the chalice became their emblem.

The radicals (the radical party) had their gathering-places all around the country. Their first armed assault fell on the small town of Ústí, on the river Lužnice, south of Prague (today's [[Sezimovo Ústí]]). However, as the place did not prove to be defensible, they settled in the remains of an older town upon a hill not far away and founded a new town, which they named [[Tábor]] (after the traditional name of the mountain on which Jesus was expected to return; see [[Mark 13]]); hence they were called Táborité ([[Taborite]]s). They comprised the essential force of the radical Hussites. Their aim was to destroy the enemies of the law of God, and to defend his kingdom (which had been expected to come in a short time) by the sword. Their end-of-world visions did not come true. In order to preserve their settlement and spread their ideology, they waged bloody wars; in the beginning they observed a strict regime, inflicting the severest punishment equally for murder, as for less severe faults as adultery, perjury and [[usury]], and also tried to apply rigid Biblical standards to the social order of the time. The Taborites usually had the support of the [[Orebites]] (later called Orphans), an eastern Bohemian sect of Hussitism based in [[Hradec Králové]].

==Hussite Wars==

{{Main article|Hussite Wars}}
The news of the death of King Wenceslaus in 1419 produced a great commotion among the people of Prague. A revolution swept over the country: churches and monasteries were destroyed, and church property was seized by the Hussite nobility. It was then, and remained till much later, in question whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (Čeněk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund's claim to not be accepted. Sigismund could get possession of &quot;his&quot; kingdom only by force of arms. Pope Martin V called upon Catholics of the West to take up arms against the Hussites, declaring a crusade, and there followed twelve years of [[Hussite Wars|warfare]].

The Hussites initially campaigned defensively, but after 1427 they assumed the offensive. Apart from their religious aims, they fought for the national interests of the Czechs. The moderate and radical parties were united, and they not only repelled the attacks of the army of [[crusade]]rs but crossed the borders into neighboring countries. On March 23, 1430, [[Joan of Arc]] dictated a letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.joan-of-arc.org/joanofarc_letter_march_23_1430.html Joan of Arc Letter of March 23, 1430]&lt;/ref&gt; that threatened to lead a crusading army against the Hussites unless they returned to the Catholic faith, but her capture by English and Burgundian troops two months later would keep her from carrying out this threat.

==The Council of Basel and Compacta of Prague==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Eventually, the opponents of the Hussites found themselves forced to consider an amicable settlement. They invited a Bohemian embassy to appear at the [[Council of Basel]]. The discussions began on 10 January 1432, centering chiefly on the four articles of [[Prague]]. No agreement emerged. After repeated negotiations between the Basel Council and Bohemia, a Bohemian–Moravian state assembly in Prague accepted the ''&quot;Compacta&quot;'' of Prague on 30 November 1433. The agreement granted communion in both kinds to all who desired it, but with the understanding that Christ was entirely present in each kind. Free preaching was granted conditionally: the Church hierarchy had to approve and place priests, and the power of the bishop must be considered. The article which prohibited the secular power of the clergy was almost reversed.

The Taborites refused to conform. The Calixtines united with the Roman Catholics and destroyed the Taborites at the [[Battle of Lipany]] on (30 May 1434). From that time, the Taborites lost their importance, though the Hussite movement would continue in [[Poland]] for another five years, until the Royalist forces of Poland defeated the Polish Hussites at the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. The state assembly of [[Jihlava]] in 1436 confirmed the ''&quot;Compacta&quot;'' and gave them the sanction of law. This accomplished the reconciliation of Bohemia with Rome and the Western Church, and at last Sigismund obtained possession of the Bohemian crown. His reactionary measures caused a ferment in the whole country, but he died in 1437. The state assembly in Prague rejected Wyclif's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which was obnoxious to the [[Utraquists]], as heresy in 1444. Most of the Taborites now went over to the party of the Utraquists; the rest joined the &quot;Brothers of the Law of Christ&quot; ({{lang-la|&quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot;}}) (see [[Unity of the Brethren]]; also [[Bohemian Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church]]).

==Reorganisation of the Hussites==
{{Protestantism}}
{{Main article|History of the Moravian Church}}
In 1462, [[Pope Pius II]] declared the ''&quot;Compacta&quot;'' null and void, prohibited communion in both kinds, and acknowledged King [[George of Podebrady]] as king on condition that he would promise an unconditional harmony with the Roman Church. This he refused, but his successor, King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], favored the Roman Catholics and proceeded against some zealous clergymen of the Calixtines. The troubles of the Utraquists increased from year to year. In 1485, at the [[Religious peace of Kutná Hora|Diet of Kutná Hora]], an agreement was made between the Roman Catholics and Utraquists that lasted for thirty-one years. It was only later, at the Diet of 1512, that the equal rights of both religions were permanently established. The appearance of [[Martin Luther]] was hailed by the Utraquist clergy, and Luther himself was astonished to find so many points of agreement between the doctrines of Hus and his own. But not all Utraquists approved of the German [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; a schism arose among them, and many returned to the Roman doctrine, while other elements had organised the ''&quot;[[Unitas Fratrum]]&quot;'' already in 1457.

Under Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], the Bohemian state assembly established the ''&quot;Confessio Bohemica,&quot;'' upon which Lutherans, Reformed, and Bohemian Brethren agreed. From that time forward Hussitism began to die out. After the [[Battle of the White Mountain|Battle of White Mountain]] on 8 November 1620 the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Faith]] was re-established with vigour, which fundamentally changed the religious conditions of the [[Czech lands]].

Leaders and members of [[Unitas Fratrum]] were forced to choose to either leave the many and varied southeastern principalities of what was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (mainly [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and parts of Germany and its many states), or to practice their beliefs secretly. As a result, members were forced underground and dispersed across northwestern Europe. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in Lissa ([[Leszno]]) in Poland, which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and in small, isolated groups in Moravia. Some, among them [[Jan Amos Comenius]], fled to western Europe, mainly the [[Low Countries]]. A settlement of Hussites in [[Herrnhut]], Saxony, now Germany, in 1722 caused the emergence of the [[Moravian Church]].

Today, the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] claims to be the modern successor of the Hussite tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nĕmec&quot;/&gt;

'''Saint Herman of Alaska''' ({{lang-rus|Преподобный Герман Аляскинский|r=Prepodobnyy German Alyaskinskiy}}; {{c.}} 1750s – November 15, 1836) was a [[Russian Orthodox]] [[monk]] and missionary to [[Alaska]], which was then part of [[Russian America]]. His gentle approach and ascetic life earned him the love and respect of both the native Alaskans and the Russian colonists. He is considered by many Orthodox Christians as the [[patron saint]] of North America.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;Walsh, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Biographers disagree about Herman’s early life. His official biography, which Valaam Monastery published in 1867, said that his pre-monastic name was unknown, but that Herman was born into a merchant’s family in [[Serpukhov]], a city in [[Moscow Governorate]]. He was said to later become a novice at the [[Trinity-St. Sergius Hermitage]] near [[St. Petersburg]] before going to [[Valaam]] to complete his training and receive full tonsure as a monk.&lt;ref&gt;''Little Russian Philokalia,'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; But, modern biographer Sergei Korsun found this account to be based on erroneous information provided by [[Semyon Yanovsky]], an administrator from 1818 through part of 1820 of the [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC) in Alaska. He confused Herman’s biographical information with that of another monk, Joseph (Telepnev).&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another former RAC Chief Manager, [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]], stated Herman was originally from a prosperous peasant family in the [[Voronezh Governorate]] and served in the military. He then entered monastic life as a novice at [[Sarov]] Monastery. This concurred with testimony of Archimandrite Theophan (Sokolov), and a letter written by Herman himself. These agree that Herman began his monastic life as a novice at Sarov, and later received the full tonsure at [[Valaam]].&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; A young military clerk named '''Egor Ivanovich Popov,''' from the [[Voronezh Governorate]], was tonsured with the name 'Herman' at Valaam in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

All biographers agree that at Valaam, Herman studied under Abbot Nazarius, previously of Sarov Monastery. The abbot had been influenced by the [[hesychastic]] tradition of [[Paisius Velichkovsky]]. Herman undertook various obediences and was well-liked by the brethren, but wanted a more solitary life. He became a hermit with Abbot Nazarius' blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; His hermitage, which later became known as “Herman’s field” or Germanovo, was two kilometers from the monastery.&lt;ref name=Kovalskaya&gt;&quot;German Alyaskinsky.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Gabriel of St. Petersburg offered to ordain Herman to the priesthood and twice offered to send him to lead the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, but he refused, preferring the solitary life and remaining a simple monk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovalskaya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Years after he left for North America, Herman continued to keep in touch with his spiritual home.&lt;ref&gt;''Little Russian Philokalia,'' p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Abbot Nazarius, he wrote, “in my mind I imagine my beloved Valaam, and constantly behold it across the great ocean.”&lt;ref&gt;''Little Russian Philokalia,'' p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission in Alaska==
[[File:Grigory Shelikov.jpg|thumbnail|right|Grigory Shelikhov, the founder of the Kodiak Island settlement, invited the first Russian Orthodox missionaries to the New World.]]
The [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] began when [[Vitus Bering]] and [[Aleksei Chirikov]] discovered Alaska in 1741. The expedition harvested 1,500 [[sea otter]] pelts, which Chinese merchants bought for 1,000 [[rubles]] each at their trading post near [[Lake Baikal]]. This spurred a “fur rush” from 1741–1798 in which frontiersmen known as ''[[promyshlenniki]]'' explored Alaska and the [[Aleutian Islands]] and alternately fought and intermarried with the native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Oleksa, pp. 81–88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grigory Shelikhov]], a fur-trader, subjugated the native population of [[Kodiak Island]] and with Ivan Golikov founded a fur-trading company which eventually received a monopoly from the Imperial government and became the Russian-American Company. Shelikhov founded a school for the natives, of whom many were converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleksa, pp. 89–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shelikhov-Golikov Company]] appealed to the [[Most Holy Synod]] of the Russian Orthodox Church to provide a priest for the natives. [[Catherine the Great]] decided instead to send an entire mission to America. She entrusted the task of recruiting missionaries to Metropolitan Gabriel of St. Petersburg, who sent ten monks from Valaam, including Herman.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The missionaries arrived on Kodiak on September 24, 1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oleksa, p. 109&quot;&gt;Oleksa, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman and the other missionaries encountered a harsh reality at Kodiak that did not correspond to Shelikhov’s rosy descriptions. The native Kodiak population, called “Americans” by the Russian settlers, were subject to harsh treatment by the Russian-American Company, which was being overseen by Shelikhov’s manager [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexander Baranov]] who later became the first governor of the colony. The men were forced to hunt for sea otter even during harsh weather, and women and children were abused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oleksa, p. 109&quot;/&gt; The monks were also shocked at the widespread alcoholism in the Russian population, and the fact that most of the settlers had taken native mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The monks themselves were not given the supplies that Shelikhov promised them,&lt;ref&gt;Oleksa, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and had to till the ground with wooden implements.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these difficulties, the monks managed to baptize over 7,000 natives in the Kodiak region, and set about building a church and monastery. Herman was assigned in the bakery and acted as the mission’s steward (''ekonom'').&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 24, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monks became the defenders of the native Kodiak population. Herman was especially noted for his zeal in protecting them from the excessive demands of the RAC, and Baranov disparaged him in a letter as a “hack writer and chatterer.”&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary historian compares him to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], the Roman Catholic friar who defended the rights of native South Americans against the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

After over a decade spent in Alaska, Herman became the head of the mission in 1807, although he was not ordained to the priesthood. The local population loved and respected him, and he even had good relations with Baranov.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Herman ran the mission school, where he taught church subjects such as singing and catechism alongside reading and writing. He also taught agriculture on [[Spruce Island (Alaska)|Spruce Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because he longed for the life of a hermit he soon retired from active duty in the mission and moved to Spruce Island.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life on Spruce Island==
Herman moved to Spruce Island around 1811 to 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The island is separated from Kodiak by a mile-wide strait, making it ideal for eremetic life. Herman named his hermitage “New Valaam.” He wore simple clothes and slept on a bench covered with a deerskin. When asked how he could bear to be alone in the forest, he replied, “I am not alone. God is here, as God is everywhere.”&lt;ref&gt;Oleksa, pp. 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his solitary life, he soon gained a following. He received many visitors—especially native Aleuts—on Sundays and church feasts. Soon his hermitage had next to it a chapel and guesthouse, and then a school for orphans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovalskaya&quot; /&gt; Herman had a few disciples, including the Creole orphan Gerasim Ivanovich Zyrianov, a young Aleut woman named Sofia Vlasova, and others. Entire families moved in order to be closer to the Elder, who helped to sort out their disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Herman had a deep love for the native Aleuts: he stood up for them against the excesses of the Russian-American Company, and once during an epidemic he was the only Russian to visit them, working tirelessly to care for the sick and console the dying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovalskaya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little Russian Philokalia, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Herman spent the rest of his life on Spruce Island, where he died on November 15, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Although his official hagiography states that he died on December 13, 1837, this was a mistake, and the correct date is given according to the dispatch by the company manager Kupreyanov to the bishop of Irkutsk. See Korsun, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sainthood==
[[File:Sts. Sergius and Herman of Valaam Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saints [[Sergius of Valaam|Sergius]] and [[Herman of Valaam]] Chapel, built in 1898 over the site where St. Herman was buried on [[Spruce Island]] in December 1836. Located near Monk's Lagoon, in the immediate vicinity of St. Herman's hermitage.]]

On March 11, 1969, the bishops of the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (OCA) formally declared their intention to canonize Herman, “as a sublime example of the Holy Life, for our spiritual benefit, inspiration, comfort, and the confirmation of our Faith.”&lt;ref&gt;“Address of the Great Council.”&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 1970, Metropolitan [[Ireney (Bekish)]] of the OCA along with Archbishop [[Paul (Olmari)]] of Finland and other hierarchs and clergy presided over the canonization service,&lt;ref&gt;“Hierarchs and Clergy.”&lt;/ref&gt; which was held at Holy Resurrection Cathedral on Kodiak Island.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; His relics were transferred from his grave underneath the [[Sts. Sergius and Herman of Valaam Chapel]] (i.e., the Saints [[Sergius of Valaam|Sergius]] and [[Herman of Valaam]] Chapel), on Spruce Island, to the Holy Resurrection Cathedral.

On the same date, the bishops of the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]] also canonized Herman at the [[Holy Virgin Cathedral]] (“Joy of All Who Sorrow”) in San Francisco. At the [[all-night vigil]], the [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] to St. Herman was read for the first time by Brother Gleb Podmoshensky (later Fr. Herman), one of the founding brothers of the St. Herman of Alaska Serbian Orthodox Brotherhood in 1963. He, [[Seraphim Rose|Eugene (Seraphim) Rose]], and Lawrence Campbell (now Monk John of [[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville)]]) gathered material for the Synod of Bishops in order to support the glorification of St. Herman, and also helped compose the liturgical service in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Korsun, pp. 179–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several feast days throughout the year on which Saint Herman of Alaska is commemorated. Since there are two different calendars currently in use among various Orthodox churches, two dates are listed: the first date is the date on the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], the second date, after the slash, is the same day on the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]:

*'''July 27/August 9—Glorification:''' This is the anniversary of the joint-glorification ([[canonization]]) of Herman of Alaska as a saint in 1970.
*'''November 15/28—Repose:''' This is the anniversary of the actual death of Saint Herman.
*'''December 13/26—Repose:''' Due to an error in record keeping, this was originally thought to be the day of Saint Herman's death, and because of the long-established tradition of celebrating his memory on this day, it has remained a feast day. It is more likely that this is the day he was buried. For those Orthodox Christians who follow the Julian Calendar, this day falls on December 26 of the Gregorian Calendar.
*'''Second Sunday after Pentecost:''', as one of the saints commemorated on the Synaxis of the Saints of North America—this is a [[moveable feast]] of the [[ecclesiastical year]], and the date of its observance will change from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;“Second Sunday after Pentecost”&lt;/ref&gt;

The major portion of his relics are preserved at Holy Resurrection Cathedral in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], while his burial site at the Sts. [[Sergius of Valaam|Sergius]] and [[Herman of Valaam|Herman]] Chapel, Spruce Island, Alaska is an important [[pilgrim]]age site, where the devout will often take soil from his grave and water from the [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] named in his honour.  A portion of his relics are enshrined at the [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius]] Chapel at the [[Antiochan Village]] in [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;“Antiochian Village”&lt;/ref&gt; a conference and retreat center of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]], where he is regarded as one of their patron saints.

In 1963, with the blessing of [[John of Shanghai and San Francisco|St. John Maximovitch]], Archbishop of Shanghai and San Francisco, a community of Orthodox booksellers and publishers called the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood was formed to publish Orthodox missionary information in English. One of the founders was Father [[Seraphim Rose]]. The Brotherhood did much to advance the cause of St. Herman's glorification as a saint. [[Saint Herman's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] in Kodiak, Alaska is named in his honor, as are numerous [[parish church]]es throughout the world.

On Tuesday, August 4, 1970, the [[91st United States Congress|91st]] [[Congress of the United States]] acknowledged the Glorification of St Herman of Alaska with a speech in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], and his biography was formally entered into the [[Congressional Record]].&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Patriarch of Moscow|Patriarch]] [[Alexis II of Moscow|Alexis II]] visited Kodiak to venerate the relics of Saint Herman. He left as a gift an ornate ''[[lampada]]'' (oil lamp) which burns constantly over the [[reliquary]]. Pilgrims from all over the world are [[anointing|anointed]] with [[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oil]] from this lampada.

Herman is also honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on August 9.&lt;ref&gt;“Herman of Alaska&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] chapel in [[Tapiola]], [[Finland]] is dedicated to St. Herman of Alaska.

'''Hausdorff dimension''' is a concept in [[mathematics]] introduced in 1918 by [[mathematician]] [[Felix Hausdorff]], and it serves as a measure of the local size of a [[space (mathematics)|space]], taking into account the distance between its points. Applying its mathematical formalisms provides that the Hausdorff dimension of a single [[point (geometry)|point]] is zero, of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is 1, and of a [[square]] is 2, of a [[cube]] is 3. That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners—the shapes of traditional geometry and science—the Hausdorff dimension is an [[integer]] agreeing with [[Inductive dimension|a dimension corresponding to its topology]]. However, formalisms have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, based solely on its properties of [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] and [[self-similarity]], one is led to the conclusion that particular objects—including [[fractal]]s—have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by [[Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch]] allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the ''Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension.''

The Hausdorff dimension is, more specifically, a further dimensional number associated with a given set of numbers, where the distances between all members of that set are defined, and where the dimension is drawn from the [[real number]]s, ℝ, to which two elements have been added, +∞ and −∞ (read as positive and negative infinity, respectively). The set that provides the Hausdorff dimension is called the [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]], {{Overline|R}}, and a set of numbers where distances between all members are defined is termed a [[metric space]],&lt;ref&gt;The distances, taken together, are called a [[metric space|metric]] on the set.&lt;/ref&gt; so that foregoing can be succinctly stated, saying the Hausdorff dimension is a non-negative [[extended real number line|extended real number]] ({{Overline|R}} ≥ 0) associated with any [[metric space]].

In mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real [[vector space]]. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an ''n''-dimensional [[inner product space]] equals ''n''. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that [[fractal|irregular sets]] can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]] summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new [[equilateral]] triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Riddle, 2014, &quot;Classic Iterated Function Systems: Koch Snowflake&quot;, Agnes Scott College e-Academy (online), see [http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/ksnow/ksnow.htm], accessed 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original.&lt;ref name=CampbellAnnenberg15/&gt; Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=ClaytonSCTPLS96&gt;Keith Clayton, 1996, &quot;Fractals and the Fractal Dimension,&quot; ''Basic Concepts in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos'' (workshop), Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences annual meeting, June 28, 1996, Berkeley, California, see [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/cogsci/chaos/workshop/Workshop.html], accessed 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.

The Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension]].

==Intuition==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
The intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object ''X'' is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the [[cardinality]] of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the [[real line]] (this can be seen by an [[Cantor's diagonal argument|argument]] involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a [[space-filling curve]] shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and ''continuously'', so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.

Every space filling curve hits some points multiple times, and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called [[Lebesgue covering dimension]], explains why. This dimension is ''n'' if, in every covering of ''X'' by small open balls, there is at least one point where ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

But topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A [[fractal]] has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.

The Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the [[metric space|metric]]. Consider the number ''N''(''r'') of [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] of radius at most ''r'' required to cover ''X'' completely. When ''r'' is very small, ''N''(''r'') grows polynomially with 1/''r''. For a sufficiently well-behaved  ''X'', the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number ''d'' such that N(''r'') grows as 1/''r&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'' as ''r'' approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]], which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value ''d'' is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.

For shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] observed that [[fractal]]s, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature. He observed that the proper idealization of most rough shapes you see around you is not in terms of smooth idealized shapes, but in terms of fractal idealized shapes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.&lt;ref name=&quot;mandelbrot&quot;&gt;{{cite book   | last = Mandelbrot   | first = Benoît   | authorlink = Benoît Mandelbrot   | title = The Fractal Geometry of Nature   | publisher = W. H. Freeman   | series = Lecture notes in mathematics 1358   | year = 1982   | doi =   | isbn = 0-7167-1186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For fractals that occur in nature, the Hausdorff and [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]] coincide. The [[packing dimension]] is yet another similar notion which gives the same value for many shapes, but there are well documented exceptions where all these dimensions differ.

==Formal definitions==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}

===Hausdorff content===
Let ''X'' be a [[metric space]]. If ''S'' ⊂ ''X'' and ''d'' ∈ [0, ∞), the ''d''-dimensional '''Hausdorff content''' of ''S'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;C_H^d(S):=\inf\Bigl\{\sum_i r_i^d:\text{ there is a cover of } S\text{ by balls with radii }r_i&gt;0\Bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, &lt;math&gt;C_H^d(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[infimum]] of the set of numbers δ ≥ 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]s &lt;math&gt;\{B(x_i,r_i):i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; covering ''S'' with ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 for each ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'' that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I} r_i^d&lt;\delta &lt;/math&gt;. (Here, we use the standard convention that [[infimum|inf&amp;nbsp;Ø&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞]].)

===Hausdorff dimension===
The '''Hausdorff dimension''' of ''X'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\dim_{\operatorname{H}}(X):=\inf\{d\ge 0: C_H^d(X)=0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, dim&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') may be defined as the [[infimum]] of the set of ''d'' ∈ [0, ∞) such that the ''d''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] of ''X'' is zero. This is the same as the supremum of the set of ''d''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞) such that the ''d''-dimensional Hausdorff measure of ''X'' is infinite (except that when this latter set of numbers ''d'' is empty the Hausdorff dimension is zero).

* An early paper by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] entitled ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

==Properties of Hausdorff dimension==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

=== Hausdorff dimension and inductive dimension ===
Let ''X'' be an arbitrary [[Separable space|separable]] metric space. There is a [[topology|topological]] notion of [[inductive dimension]] for ''X'' which is defined recursively. It is always an integer (or +∞) and is denoted dim&lt;sub&gt;ind&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''X'' is non-empty. Then 
:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\mathrm{Haus}}(X) \geq \dim_{\operatorname{ind}}(X). &lt;/math&gt;
Moreover,
:&lt;math&gt; \inf_Y \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(Y) =\dim_{\operatorname{ind}}(X), &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Y'' ranges over metric spaces [[homeomorphic]] to ''X''. In other words, ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same underlying set of points and the metric ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' is topologically equivalent to ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

These results were originally established by [[Edward Szpilrajn]] (1907–1976), e.g., see Hurewicz and Wallman, Chapter VII.{{full|date=March 2015}}

=== Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension ===
The [[Minkowski dimension]] is similar to, and at least as large as, the Hausdorff dimension, and they are equal in many situations. However, the set of [[rational number|rational]] points in [0, 1] has Hausdorff dimension zero and Minkowski dimension one. There are also compact sets for which the Minkowski dimension is strictly larger than the Hausdorff dimension.

=== Hausdorff dimensions and Frostman measures ===
If there is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] μ defined on [[Borel measure|Borel]] subsets of a metric space ''X'' such that ''μ''(''X'') &gt; 0 and ''μ''(''B''(''x'', ''r'')) ≤ ''r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' holds for some constant ''s'' &gt; 0 and for every ball ''B''(''x'', ''r'') in ''X'', then dim&lt;sub&gt;Haus&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') ≥ ''s''. A partial converse is provided by [[Frostman's lemma]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;This Wikipedia article also discusses further useful characterizations of the Hausdorff dimension.{{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behaviour under unions and products ===
If &lt;math&gt;X=\bigcup_{i\in I}X_i&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or countable union, then

:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X) =\sup_{i\in I} \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X_i).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be verified directly from the definition.

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are non-empty metric spaces, then the Hausdorff dimension of their product satisfies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marstrand, J. M. |title=The dimension of Cartesian product sets |journal=Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=198–202 |year=1954 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100029236 |bibcode = 1954PCPS...50..198M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X\times Y)\ge \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X)+ \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(Y).&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality can be strict. It is possible to find two sets of dimension 0 whose product has dimension 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Falconer  | first = Kenneth J.  | title = Fractal geometry. Mathematical foundations and applications  | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey  | year = 2003  | doi =   | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite direction, it is known that when ''X'' and ''Y'' are Borel subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the Hausdorff dimension of ''X'' × ''Y'' is bounded from above by the Hausdorff dimension of ''X'' plus the [[packing dimension|upper packing dimension]] of ''Y''. These facts are discussed in Mattila (1995).
===The Hausdorff Dimension Theorem===
'''Theorem'''. For any given &lt;math&gt; r&gt;0,  &lt;/math&gt; there are uncountable fractals with Hausdorff dimension &lt;math&gt; r   &lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt; R^{n}, (n \geq \lceil r \rceil). &lt;/math&gt;   &lt;ref&gt;   Mohsen Soltanifar.(2006).On A sequence of cantor Fractals, Rose Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal, Vol 7, No 1, paper 9,  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-similar sets==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Many sets defined by a self-similarity condition have dimensions which can be determined explicitly. Roughly, a set ''E'' is self-similar if it is the fixed point of a set-valued transformation ψ, that is ψ(''E'') = ''E'', although the exact definition is given below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem'''. Suppose

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_i: \mathbf{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n, \quad i=1, \ldots , m &lt;/math&gt;

are [[Contraction mapping|contractive]] mappings on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with contraction constant ''r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; 1. Then there is a unique ''non-empty'' compact set ''A'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; A = \bigcup_{i=1}^m \psi_i (A). &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theorem follows from [[Stefan Banach]]'s [[Contractive mapping theorem|contractive mapping fixed point theorem]] applied to the complete metric space of non-empty compact subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the [[Hausdorff distance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Falconer, K. J. |title=The Geometry of Fractal Sets |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-25694-1 |chapter=Theorem 8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The open set condition===
To determine the dimension of the self-similar set ''A'' (in certain cases), we need a technical condition called the ''open set condition'' (OSC) on the sequence of contractions ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is a relatively compact open set ''V'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{i=1}^m\psi_i (V) \subseteq V, &lt;/math&gt;

where the sets in union on the left are pairwise [[disjoint sets|disjoint]].

The open set condition is a separation condition that ensures the images ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'') do not overlap &quot;too much&quot;.

'''Theorem'''. Suppose the open set condition holds and each ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a similitude, that is a composition of an [[isometry]] and a [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]] around some point. Then the unique fixed point of ψ is a set whose Hausdorff dimension is ''s'' where ''s'' is the unique solution of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hutchinson | first=John E. | title=Fractals and self similarity | journal=Indiana Univ. Math. J. | volume=30 | year=1981 | pages=713–747 | doi=10.1512/iumj.1981.30.30055 | issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^s = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The contraction coefficient of a similitude is the magnitude of the dilation.

We can use this theorem to compute the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle (or sometimes called Sierpinski gasket). Consider three [[non-collinear points]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and let ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the dilation of ratio 1/2 around ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The unique non-empty fixed point of the corresponding mapping ψ is a Sierpinski gasket and the dimension ''s'' is the unique solution of
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s = 3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s =1. &lt;/math&gt;

Taking [[natural logarithm]]s of both sides of the above equation, we can solve for ''s'', that is: ''s'' = ln(3)/ln(2).  The Sierpinski gasket is self-similar and satisfies the OSC. In general a set ''E'' which is a fixed point of a mapping

: &lt;math&gt; A \mapsto \psi(A) = \bigcup_{i=1}^m \psi_i(A) &lt;/math&gt;

is self-similar if and only if the intersections

:&lt;math&gt; H^s\left(\psi_i(E) \cap \psi_j(E)\right) =0, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the Hausdorff dimension of ''E'' and ''H&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes [[Hausdorff measure]]. This is clear in the case of the Sierpinski gasket (the intersections are just points), but is also true more generally:

'''Theorem'''. Under the same conditions as the previous theorem, the unique fixed point of ψ is self-similar.

'''Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH''' ('''HK''') ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛklɐʔʊntˈkɔx}}) is a German [[Defense industry|defense]] manufacturing [[corporation|company]] that manufactures [[handgun]]s, [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], [[submachine guns]], and [[grenade launchers]]. The company is located in [[Oberndorf am Neckar|Oberndorf]] in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]], and also has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France and the United States.

The Heckler &amp; Koch Group comprises Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH, Heckler &amp; Koch Defense, NSAF Ltd., and Heckler &amp; Koch France SAS. The company's motto is &quot;''Keine Kompromisse!''&quot; (No Compromises!).&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt; HK provides firearms for many military and paramilitary units, like the [[Special Air Service|SAS]], [[Royal Marechaussee|KMar]], the US [[U.S. Navy SEALs|Navy Seals]], [[Delta Force]], [[Hostage Rescue Team|HRT]], Canada's [[Joint Task Force 2]], the German [[Kommando Spezialkräfte|KSK]] and [[GSG 9]] and many other counter-terrorist and hostage rescue teams.

Some of their more notable products include the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|MP5]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch UMP|UMP]] [[submachine gun]]s, the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK417|HK417]] [[battle rifle]]s, the [[Heckler &amp; Koch 33|HK33]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36|G36]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK416|HK416]] [[assault rifle]]s, the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MG5|MG5]],  [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK21|HK21]] [[General-purpose machine gun]]s, the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP7|MP7]] [[personal defense weapon]], the [[Heckler &amp; Koch USP|USP]] series of [[handguns]], and the high-precision [[Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1|PSG1]] [[sniper rifle]]. All firearms made by HK are named by a prefix and the official designation, with suffixes used for variants.

HK has a history of innovation in firearms, such as the use of [[polymer]]s in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern [[polygonal rifling]], noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoggWeeks1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogg|first1=Ian V.|last2=Weeks|first2=John|title=Pistols of the World: The Definitive Illustrated Guide to the World's Pistols and Revolvers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHC4mwmb1qEC|year=1992|publisher=DBI Books|isbn=978-0-87349-128-0|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11|G11]] military rifle, which fired [[Caseless ammunition|caseless]] high-velocity ammunition). In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: [[Blowback (arms)|blowback operation]], [[short-recoil]], [[Blowback (arms)#Roller delayed|roller-delayed blowback]], [[Blowback (arms)#Gas delayed|gas-delayed blowback]], and [[Gas-operated reloading|gas operation]] (via Short-stroke piston).

==History==
With the fall of Germany at the end of World War II, [[Oberndorf am Neckar|Oberndorf]] came under French control, and the entire [[Mauser|Waffenfabrik Mauser AG]] factory was dismantled by French occupying forces. All records in the factory were destroyed on orders of the local French Army commander. In 1948, three former Mauser engineers, [[Edmund Heckler]], [[Theodor Koch]], and [[Alex Seidel]] saved what they could from the factory and what they salvaged was used to start a machine tool plant in the vacant factory that became known as the Engineering Office Heckler &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=Lee2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=Standard Catalog of Rifles &amp; Shotguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLlG3aX7enAC&amp;pg=PT1143|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-3014-5|page=1143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=The Official Gun Digest Book of Guns &amp; Prices 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyYXCAyeBZwC&amp;pg=PA490|year=2013|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3543-6|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 1949, the Engineering Office Heckler &amp; Co. changed its name and was registered officially as Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH. Initially the new company manufactured machine tools, bicycle and [[sewing machine]] parts, gauges and other precision parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Firearms: An Illustrated History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ma0MAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA256|year=2014|publisher=DK Publishing/ Smithsonian Institution|isbn=978-1-4654-3089-2|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Heckler &amp; Koch responded to the [[West German]] Government's tender for a new infantry rifle for the [[Bundeswehr]] (German Federal Army) with the proposal of the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3 battle rifle]], which was based on the Spanish [[CETME]] rifle.&lt;ref name=Lee2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee2013/&gt; The German Government awarded Heckler &amp; Koch this tender and by 1959, declared the G3 as the standard rifle of the Bundeswehr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwing2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwing|first=Ned|title=Standard Catalog of Military Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xrmt_KlkvcC&amp;pg=PA174|date=5 November 2005|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87349-902-6|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HKG3&gt;{{cite book|last=Tilstra|first=Russell C.|title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_a0zAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=21 March 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-1564-6|pages=38–50|chapter=HK G3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Heckler &amp; Koch developed the 7.62×51mm [[HK21| HK21 general-purpose machine gun]], based on the G3 battle rifle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutshaw2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutshaw|first=Charles Q.|title=Tactical Small Arms of the 21st Century: A Complete Guide to Small Arms From Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npHP9aV5rBgC&amp;pg=PA368|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2482-X|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Heckler &amp; Koch introduced the HK54 machine pistol, which eventually launched in 1969 as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|MP5 machine pistol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MusgraveOliver1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musgrave|first1=Daniel D.|last2=Oliver|first2=Smith Hempstone|title=German Machineguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_9CAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=MOR Associates|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the company introduced the 5.56×45mm [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK33|HK33]] assault rifle, which is a smaller version of the G3 battle rifle chambered in 5.56mm NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gander|first= Terry J.|editor= Hogg, Ian V. |title=Jane's Infantry Weapons 1995/1996|publisher=Jane's Information Group|edition= 21 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willbanks2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Willbanks|first=James H.|title=Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWkYoAkoMHIC&amp;pg=PA138|date=1 January 2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-480-6|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversification===
In 1974, Heckler &amp; Koch diversified into the following two business areas: HK Defense and Law Enforcement Technology and HK Hunting and Sports Firearms. Since then HK has designed and manufactured more than one hundred different types of firearms and devices for the world's military and law enforcement organizations as well as sportsmen and hunters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shideler2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Shideler|first=Dan|title=The Gun Digest Book of Modern Gun Values: The Shooter's Guide to Guns 1900-Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWFXRDeFrpsC&amp;pg=PA326|year=2009|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89689-824-5|pages=322–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Heckler &amp; Koch finalised over two decades of development with their revolutionary case-less weapon system and produces prototypes of the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11|HK G11]].  In addition, the company produced prototypes of the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G41|HK G41 military rifle]] intended for the Bundeswehr.  Due to the international political climate at that time (East and West Germany uniting and defense budget cuts) the company was unable to secure funded contracts from the German Government to support production of either weapon system and this resulted in the company becoming financially vulnerable. In the following year, the Heckler &amp; Koch company was sold to the [[British Aerospace]]'s [[Royal Ordnance]] division.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heckler-koch.de/ |title=www.heckler-koch.de |publisher=www.heckler-koch.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1994 and 1995, the German Government awarded Heckler &amp; Koch with contracts for producing an updated standard assault rifle and updated standard sidearm for the Bundeswehr. As a result, Heckler &amp; Koch developed and produced the Project HK50, a lightweight [[carbon fiber]]–reinforced polymer [[assault rifle]], which became the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36|HK G36 assault rifle]].  In addition, Heckler &amp; Koch produced the [[Heckler &amp; Koch P8|HK P8]] derived as a variant based upon its Universale Selbstladepistole (USP) series of handguns (which had been in production since 1989).  The P8 was adopted as the standard issue handgun for the Bundeswehr in 1994 and the G36 was adopted in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;hk_p8&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last = Heckler &amp; Koch Global  | title = Pistole P8  | url = http://www.heckler-koch.de/HKWebText/detailProd/1925/121/4/21  | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the result of a 1999 merger between British Aerospace and [[Marconi Electronic Systems]], Heckler &amp; Koch was then owned by [[BAE Systems]] and was contracted to refurbish the [[SA80]] rifle for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=SA80&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/support-weapons/1458.aspx |title=British Army Website information page on the SA80 A2 rifle |accessdate=2008-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828040318/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/support-weapons/1458.aspx |archivedate=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contract entailed a modification programme to the SA80 series of rifles  to address a number of reliability issues with the SA80. Three years later in 2002, BAE Systems restructured and sold Heckler &amp; Koch to a group of private investors, who created the German group holding company (HK Beteiligungs-GmbH).

In 2003, the HK Beteiligungs GmbH group's business organization restructured as Heckler &amp; Koch Jagd und Sportwaffen GmbH (HKJS) and its business was separated into the following two business areas (similar to the 1974 business mission areas):  Defense and Law Enforcement and Sporting Firearms.

In 2004, Heckler &amp; Koch was awarded a major handgun contract for the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security|DHS]], worth a potential $26.2 million for up to 65,000 handguns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_11_49/ai_n7579143|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707233942/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3197/is_11_49/ai_n7579143|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-07|title=Industry arms Homeland Security|accessdate=2008-08-30 | work=Shooting Industry | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contract ranks as the single largest handgun procurement contract in US law enforcement history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hksystems.com.au/news.htm |title=HK Australia website |accessdate=2008-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719173707/http://www.hksystems.com.au/news.htm |archivedate=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heckler &amp; Koch Oberndorf 01.jpg|thumb|left|Heckler &amp; Koch facility in [[Oberndorf am Neckar]].]]
HK was contracted by the [[United States Army]] to produce the [[kinetic energy]] subsystem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegunsource.com/Heckler-Koch.aspx |title=The Gun Source - HK |accessdate=2008-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522150520/http://www.thegunsource.com/Heckler-Koch.aspx |archivedate=22 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[kinetic projectile]]s or [[kinetic energy penetrator]]) of the [[XM29 OICW|Objective Individual Combat Weapon]], a planned replacement for the [[M16 (rifle)|M16]]/[[M203 grenade launcher]] combination. The OICW was designed to fire [[5.56×45mm NATO|5.56&amp;nbsp;mm bullets]] and 25&amp;nbsp;mm grenades. The kinetic energy component was also developed separately as the [[XM8 rifle|XM8]], though both the OICW and XM8 are now indefinitely suspended.

Heckler &amp; Koch developed a Colt [[M4 carbine|M4]] variant, marketed as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK416|HK416]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as75-e.htm|title=Modern Firearms|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; HK replaced the [[direct impingement]] system used by the [[Eugene Stoner|Stoner]] design on the original M16 with a [[Gas-operated#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke piston]] operating system.

At this date, there is no indication that the rifle will be adopted by the [[United States Armed Forces]]; other than use in the Marine Corps as the IAR or M27. However, the elite [[Delta Force]] and other [[United States Special Operations Command|special operations]] units have fielded the [[HK416]] in combat,&lt;ref name=&quot;Delta Force&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cox|first=Matthew|date=March 1, 2007|title=Better than M4, but you can't have one|journal=Army Times |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/02/atCarbine070219/|accessdate=2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oklahoma]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tom Coburn]] has called for a &quot;free and open competition&quot; to determine whether the army should buy the HK416 or continue to purchase more M4 carbines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coburn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lowe |first=Christian |date=April 30, 2007 |title=Senator Tells Army to Reconsider M4 |journal=Military.com |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,133962,00.html |accessdate=2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Pete Geren]] agreed in July 2007 to hold a &quot;dust chamber&quot; test, pitting the M4 against HK's [[HK416]] and [[XM8]], as well as the rival [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal|Fabrique Nationale]]'s [[FN SCAR|SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR)]] design.

HK sells its pistols in the United States to both law enforcement and civilian markets. The company has locations in [[Virginia]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Trafficking allegations==

HK has been accused of shipping small arms to conflict regions such as Bosnia&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Peter, Manufacturing Trends: Globalising the Source in Lumpe, Lora (ed.) (2000), Running Guns: The Global Black Market in Small Arms, London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nepal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty2003&quot;&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/IOR30/003/2003 A Catalogue of Failures: G8 Arms Exports and Human Rights Violations (2003-05-19)], Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt; and has licensed its weapons for production by governments with poor human rights records such as [[Sudan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/conflict_disasters/downloads/control.rtf Out of Control – The loopholes in UK controls on the arms trade (1998-12)], Oxfam GB.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the company effectively evaded EU export restrictions when these licensees sold HK weapons to conflict zones including Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Steve (2001-01), [http://mondediplo.com/2001/01/02arms1 A Legal Trade In Death], Le Monde Diplomatique.&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engact300032004 Undermining Global Security: the European Union’s arms exports (2004-02-01)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031065017/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engact300032004 |date=2007-10-31 }}, Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty2003&quot;/&gt;

According to the [[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]] papers (31.8.11), as well as the state broadcaster ARD, a large stockpile of G36 assault rifles fell into rebel hands during the attack on [[Colonel Gaddafi]]'s compound in [[Tripoli]] in August 2011, reporting that pictures proved the rifles carried the company's trademark. It was unclear exactly how many or who exported them to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110831-37283.html The Local, Germany's Online English News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heckler &amp; Koch MP5''' (from {{lang-de|Maschinenpistole 5}}, meaning ''Submachine gun 5'') is a [[9×19mm Parabellum|9mm]] [[submachine gun]] of German design, developed in the 1960s by a team of engineers from the German [[small arms]] manufacturer [[Heckler &amp; Koch|Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH]] (H&amp;K) of [[Oberndorf am Neckar]]. There are over 100 variants of the MP5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/military/products/submachine-guns/mp5/mp5/overview.html |title=H&amp;K Web site, MP5 overview |publisher=Heckler-koch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some semi-automatic versions.

The MP5 is one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;hogg2002&quot;&gt;Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''. Jane's Information Group. {{ISBN|0-00-712760-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; having been adopted by 40 nations and numerous military, law enforcement, intelligence, and security organizations.{{sfn|Tilstra|2012|p=42}} It is widely used by [[SWAT]] teams in North America.

In 1999, Heckler &amp; Koch developed the [[Heckler &amp; Koch UMP]], the MP5's successor;{{sfn|Dockery|2007|p=220}} both are available {{As of|2017|lc=on}}.

==History==
Heckler &amp; Koch, encouraged by the success of the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3]] [[automatic rifle]], developed a family of small arms consisting of four types of [[firearm]]s all based on a common G3 design layout and operating principle.  The first type was chambered for [[7.62×51mm NATO]], the second for the [[7.62×39mm|7.62×39mm M43]] round, the third for the intermediate [[5.56×45mm NATO]] caliber, and the fourth type for the [[9×19mm Parabellum]] [[pistol]] cartridge. The MP5 was created within the fourth group of firearms and was initially known as the '''HK54'''.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=8}}

Work on the MP5 began in 1964 and two years later it was adopted by the [[German Federal Police]], border guard and army special forces.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=8}}

In 1980, the MP5 achieved iconic status as a result of its use on live television by SAS commandos in [[Operation Nimrod]], where they stormed the Iranian Embassy in London, rescuing hostages and killing five terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/02/joe-grine/gun-review-hk-sl8-6/|date=February 9, 2013|title=Gun Review: HK SL8-6|author=Grine, Joe|accessdate=January 7, 2015|website=[[The Truth About Guns]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MP5 became a mainstay of [[SWAT]] units of law enforcement agencies in the United States since then. However, in the late 1990s, as a result of the [[North Hollywood shootout]], police special response teams have supplanted some MP5s with [[AR-15]]-based assault rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/02/joe-grine/gun-review-hk-sl8-6/|title=Gun Review HK SL8-6|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP5 is manufactured under license in several nations including Greece (formerly at EBO – [[Hellenic Arms Industry]], currently at [[EAS (weapons)|EAS – Hellenic Defense Systems]]), [[Iran]] ([[Defense Industries Organization]]), Mexico ([[SEDENA]]), [[Pakistan]] ([[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]]), [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]] ([[Military Industry Corporation]]), [[Turkey]] ([[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKEK]]), and the United Kingdom (initially at [[Royal Ordnance]], later diverted to Heckler &amp; Koch Great Britain).&lt;ref name=&quot;worldpolicy2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports/smallarms.htm |title=Report: Profiling the Small Arms Industry – World Policy Institute – Research Project |date=November 2000 |publisher=World Policy Institute |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design details ==
The primary version of the MP5 family is the '''MP5A2''', which is a lightweight, air-cooled, [[selective fire]] [[Roller-delayed blowback|delayed blowback]] operated [[9×19mm Parabellum]] weapon with a roller-delayed bolt. It fires from a [[closed bolt]] (bolt forward) position.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=12}}

The fixed, [[Free-floating barrel|free floating]], cold hammer-forged barrel has 6 right-hand grooves with a 1 in 250&amp;nbsp;mm (1:10 in) [[rifling]] twist rate and is pressed and pinned into the receiver.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}

=== Features ===
[[File:Visierlinie.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A view through the weapon's aperture sight]]
The first MP5 models used a double-column straight [[box magazine]], but since 1977, slightly curved, [[steel]] magazines are used with a 15-round capacity (weighing 0.12&amp;nbsp;kg) or a 30-round capacity (0.17&amp;nbsp;kg empty).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}

The adjustable [[iron sight]]s (closed type) consist of a rotating rear diopter drum and a front post installed in a hooded ring. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation with the use of a special tool, being adjusted at the factory for firing at 25m with standard 124 grains FMJ 9×19mm NATO ammunition; the drum provides four different apertures of varying width used to adjust the light entrance in the diopter system, according to the user's eye relief and tactical situation.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}

The MP5 has a hammer firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an interchangeable [[polymer]] trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and equipped with a three-position fire mode selector that serves as the manual safety toggle. The &quot;S&quot; or ''Sicher'' position in white denotes weapon safe, &quot;E&quot; or ''Einzelfeuer'' in red represents single fire, and &quot;F&quot; or ''Feuerstoß'' (also marked in red) designates continuous fire. The SEF symbols appear on both sides of the plastic trigger group. The selector lever is actuated with the thumb of the shooting hand and is located only on the left side of the original SEF trigger group or on both sides of the ambidextrous trigger groups. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile clicks (stops) are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The &quot;safe&quot; setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}

The non-reciprocating [[cocking handle]] is located above the handguard and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45° angle. This rigid control is attached to a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn, makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a [[forward assist]] to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in the front end of the cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}

=== Operating mechanism ===
[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|left|The roller-delayed blowback mechanism originated from the aborted [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototypes developed in [[Nazi Germany]] at the end of [[World War II]].]]
The bolt rigidly engages the barrel extension—a cylindrical component welded to the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] into which the barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the [[G3 rifle]]. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt head with rollers and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}

When fired, expanding propellant gases produced from the burning powder in the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] exert rearward pressure on the bolt head transferred through the base of the cartridge case as it is propelled out of the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]]. A portion of this force is transmitted through the rollers projecting from the bolt head, which are cammed inward against the inclined flanks of the locking recesses in the barrel extension and to the angled shoulders of the locking piece. The selected angles of the recesses and the incline on the locking piece produce a velocity ratio of about 4:1 between the bolt carrier and the bolt head. This results in a calculated delay, allowing the projectile to exit the barrel and gas pressure to drop to a safe level before the case is extracted from the chamber.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}

The delay results from the amount of time it takes for enough recoil energy to be transferred through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber for a short period of time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4&amp;nbsp;mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}

Since the [[9×19mm Parabellum]] cartridge is relatively low powered, the bolt does not have an anti-bounce device like the G3, but instead the bolt carrier contains [[tungsten]] granules that prevent the bolt group from bouncing back after impacting the barrel extension. The weapon has a fluted chamber that enhances extraction reliability by bleeding gases backwards into the shallow flutes running along the length of the chamber to prevent the cartridge case from expanding and sticking to the chamber walls (since the bolt is opened under relatively high barrel pressure). A spring extractor is installed inside the bolt head and holds the case securely until it strikes the ejector arm and is thrown out of the ejection port to the right of the receiver. The lever-type ejector is located inside the trigger housing (activated by the movement of the recoiling bolt).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}

=== Accessories ===
In the early 1970s [[Heckler &amp; Koch|HK]] introduced a conversion kit for the MP5 that enables it to use rimfire ammunition ([[.22 LR]]). This unit consists of a barrel insert, a bolt group and two 20-round magazines. This modification reduces the cyclic rate to 650 rounds/min. It was sold mostly to law enforcement agencies as a way to train recruits on handling the MP5. It used ammunition that was cheaper and had a lower recoil than 9×19mm Parabellum. This reduced training costs and built up skill and confidence in the operators before transitioning them to the full-bore model.

Vented barrel surrounded by metal mesh packing in the expansion chambers, followed by conical baffles in the forward chambers.]]
Threading is provided at the muzzle to work with certain muzzle devices made by Heckler &amp; Koch, including: a slotted [[flash suppressor]], [[blank-firing adaptor|blank firing attachment]] (marked with a red-painted band denoting use with blank ammunition only), an adapter for launching [[rifle grenade]]s (for use with rifle-style grenades with an inside diameter of 22&amp;nbsp;mm using a special grenade launching cartridge) and a cup-type attachment used to launch [[tear gas]] grenades. An optional three-lugged barrel is also available for mounting a quick-detachable [[suppressor]].

====Receiver====
The receiver housing has a proprietary claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment of a standard Heckler &amp; Koch quick-detachable scope mount (also used with the [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK33|HK33]] and [[G3SG/1]]). It can be used to mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4×24), night sights, reflex sights and [[laser]] pointers. The mount features two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable scope mount provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the scope mount attached to the top of the receiver.

A [[Picatinny rail]] adapter can be placed on top that locks into the claw rails. This allows the mounting of [[Standardization Agreement|STANAG]] scopes and has a lower profile than the claw-rail system.

====Handguard====
Aftermarket replacement handguards with [[Picatinny rail]]s are available. Single-rail models have a Picatinny rail along the bottom and triple-rail models have rails along the bottom and sides. They allow the mounting of accessories like flashlights, laser pointers, target designators, vertical foregrips, and bipods.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=24}}

== Variants ==
The MP5A2 has a fixed buttstock (made of a synthetic polymer), whereas the compact ''MP5A3'' has a retractable metal stock. The stockless ''MP5A1'' has a buttcap with a sling mount for concealed carry; the MP5K series was a further development of this idea.{{sfn|Cutshaw|2011|p=154}}

The ''MP5A4'' (fixed stock) and ''MP5A5'' (sliding stock) models, which were introduced in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the ''MP5A1'', ''MP5A2'', and ''MP5A3''. The selector lever stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the selector lever is present on each side of the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully automatic setting, enables a two or three-shot burst firing mode.

A variant with the last trigger group designated the '''MP5-N''' (N—Navy) was developed in 1986 for the [[United States Navy]]. This model has a collapsible stock, a [[tritium]]-illuminated front sight post and a {{convert|225|mm|abbr=on|1}} threaded barrel for use with a [[stainless steel]] [[suppressor|sound suppressor]] made by [[Knight's Armament Company]] together with quieter subsonic ammunition. It had ambidextrous controls, a straight pistol grip, pictogram markings, and originally had a four-position selector (Safe, Semi-Auto, 3-Round Burst, Full Auto). This was replaced with a similar three-position ambidextrous selector after an improperly-reassembled trigger group spontaneously fired during an exercise. The &quot;Navy&quot;-style ambidextrous trigger group later became standard, replacing the classic &quot;SEF&quot;.

=== Plastic training variants ===
H&amp;K offers dedicated training variants of these weapons, designated ''MP5A4PT'' and ''MP5A5PT'' (PT—Plastic Training), modified to fire a plastic 9×19mm PT training cartridge produced by [[Dynamit Nobel AG|Dynamit Nobel]] of Germany. These weapons operate like the standard MP5 but have a floating chamber and both rollers have been omitted from the bolt to function properly when firing the lighter plastic projectiles. To help identify these weapons blue dots were painted on their cocking handles and additional lettering provided. The PT variant can be configured with various buttstocks and trigger groups and was developed for the West German Police and Border Guard.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}

=== Semi-auto only variants ===
The ''MP5SFA2'' (SF – single-fire) was developed in 1986 in response to the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] solicitation for a &quot;9&amp;nbsp;mm Single-fire Carbine&quot;. It is the same as the MP5A2 but is fitted with an ambidextrous semi-automatic only trigger group. The ''MP5SFA3'' is similar except it has a retractable metal stock like the MP5A3. Versions delivered after December 1991 are assembled with select-fire bolt carriers allowing fully automatic operation when used with the appropriate trigger module.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=47}}

The two-position trigger unit was used in the single-fire ''HK94'' [[carbine]] that was produced specifically for the civilian market with a {{convert|420|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}

=== Suppressed variants ===
In 1974 H&amp;K initiated design work on a sound-suppressed variant of the MP5, designated the '''MP5SD''' (SD—''Schalldämpfer'' German for &quot;sound suppressor&quot;), which features an integral but detachable [[aluminium]] sound suppressor and a lightweight bolt. The weapon's {{convert|146|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel has 30 {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} ports drilled forward of the chamber through which escaping gases are diverted to the surrounding sealed tubular casing that is screwed onto threading on the barrel’s external surface just prior to the ported segment. The suppressor itself is divided into two stages; the initial segment surrounding the ported barrel serves as an expansion chamber for the propellant gases, reducing gas pressure to slow down the acceleration of the projectile. The second, decompression stage occupies the remaining length of the suppressor tube and contains a stamped metal helix separator with several compartments which increase the gas volume and decrease its temperature, deflecting the gases as they exit the muzzle, so muffling the exit report. The bullet leaves the muzzle at subsonic velocity, so it does not generate a sonic [[shock wave]] in flight. As a result of reducing the barrel’s length and venting propellant gases into the suppressor, the bullet’s muzzle velocity was lowered anywhere from 16% to 26% (depending on the ammunition used) while maintaining the weapon’s automation and reliability. The weapon was designed to be used with standard supersonic ammunition with the suppressor on at all times.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}

The MP5SD is produced exclusively by H&amp;K in several versions: the ''MP5SD1'' and ''MP5SD4'' (both have a receiver end cap instead of a buttstock), ''MP5SD2'' and ''MP5SD5'' (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the ''MP5SD3'' and ''MP5SD6'' (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group—a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst mode and ambidextrous selector controls (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy&amp;nbsp;– designated the ''MP5SD-N'', which is a version of the MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=5}}

=== MP5K ===
In 1976 a shortened version of the MP5A2 was introduced; the ''MP5K'' (K from the German word ''Kurz'' = &quot;short&quot;) was designed for close quarters battle use by clandestine operations and special services. The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock (the receiver end was covered with a flat end cap, featuring a buffer on the inside and a sling loop on the outside), and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}

The MP5K is produced (by Heckler &amp; Koch and under license in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]) in four different versions: the MP5K, ''MP5KA4'', ''MP5KA1'', ''MP5KA5'', where the first two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched rotary drum), and the two remaining variants – fixed open sights; however, the front sight post was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights through the use of an adapter.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}

A civilian semiautomatic derivative of the MP5K known as the '''SP89''' was produced that had a foregrip with a muzzle guard in place of the vertical grip.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}

In 1991 a further variant of the MP5K was developed, designated the ''MP5K-PDW'' (PDW—Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the fire handling characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group, a front sight post with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a rotary drum with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=20}}

=== Larger caliber versions ===
In 1991, Heckler &amp; Koch introduced the ''MP5/10'' (chambered in [[10mm Auto]]) and ''MP5/40'' (chambered for the [[.40 S&amp;W]] cartridge), which are based on the MP5A4 and MP5A5. These weapons were assembled in fixed and retractable stock configurations (without a separate designation) and are fed from translucent 30-round polymer box magazines. These weapons include a bolt hold-open device, which captures the bolt group in its rear position after expending the last cartridge from the magazine. The bolt is then released by pressing a lever positioned on the left side of the receiver. Both weapons use a barrel with 6 right-hand grooves and a 380&amp;nbsp;mm (1:15 in) twist rate, and like the MP5-N, both have a 3-lugged muzzle device and a tritium-illuminated front sight aiming dot.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}

Problems with the MP5/10 and MP5/40 led to their discontinuation, although Heckler &amp; Koch continues to provide support and spare parts.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}

* '''HK54''': The original model that was produced in 1964. The ''54'' designation is from the Hecker &amp; Koch company's old system that indicates that it is a submachine gun/assault carbine (5-) chambered for the 9×19mm cartridge (-4). It had a charcoal-gray phosphated finish rather than the matte-black finish used on later models and had narrow slotted metal handguards. Its major differences were that it had a longer and heavier bolt carrier than the MP5 and a flip up &quot;ladder&quot;-style rear sight (like the early G3 rifle) rather than the MP5's aperture sight. Its original 15- or 30-round steel magazines were straight rather than curved, had a plastic follower, and were reinforced with ribs (thus their nickname of &quot;waffle&quot;-type magazines).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}
* '''MP5''': A slightly modified version of the HK54 first created in 1966. It has a matte-black phosphated finish instead of the grayish finish. It originally had the narrow checkered metal &quot;Slimline&quot; handguards in the place of the HK54's narrow slotted metal ones. These were later replaced by the thicker &quot;Tropical&quot; handguards. The proprietary Heckler &amp; Koch &quot;claw mount&quot; rails for mounting optical and electronic scopes were added around 1973. The improved 15- and 30-round magazines were adopted in 1977; they were curved, had unribbed sides, and had chromed-steel followers.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}

====Civilian market versions====
* '''HK94''': American import model of the MP5 with an exposed 16.54-inch [420mm] barrel and special SF (safe/semi-automatic) trigger group, designed for civilian use. The ''94'' factory designation code indicates that it is a semi-auto only Sporting Rifle (9-) chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge (-4). &lt;br&gt;A barrel-mounted vertical foregrip and a ventilated barrel shroud were available for the stock HK94. The HK94 was made from 1983 to 1989, in three different configurations:
**The '''HK94A2''' had a fixed stock, an overall length of 34.59 inches [829&amp;nbsp;mm], and weighed 6.43&amp;nbsp;lbs. [2.92&amp;nbsp;kg.]. In 1991, the state of [[California]] imported 420 HK-94A2s, mostly for their state [[California Department of Corrections|Department of Corrections]]; it was the last batch of HK-94s imported into the United States.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}
**The '''HK94A3''' had a retractable stock, an overall length of 27.58 inches [700&amp;nbsp;mm] collapsed and 34.05 inches [865&amp;nbsp;mm] extended and weighed 7.18&amp;nbsp;lbs. [3.26&amp;nbsp;kg].{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}
**The '''HK94/SG-1''' (''Scharfschützengewehr'', &quot;sharp-shooting rifle&quot;) was designed for short-range sniping in built-up areas like cities or prisons. It proved to be unsuitable for its designed purpose, due to its poor penetration and stopping power {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and most went to target shooters and collectors. It had a fixed match stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, folding bipod, flash hider, and a 6 × 42mm Leupold VIII Adjustable Objective scope. It had an overall length of 40.39 inches [1026mm] and a weight of 9.25&amp;nbsp;lbs. [4.2&amp;nbsp;kg]. Its mean standard retail price (MSRP) in 1986 was US$1,525; this was more than twice what a stock HK94A2 (US$650) or HK94A3 (US$720) cost. Only 50 were imported into the United States; authentic models have serial numbers running in the 43XX range.&lt;br&gt;As an aftermarket modification, a PSG-1 trigger pack with target pistol grip and match trigger could be added by a gunsmith by changing the ejector and hammer spring. The 6× Leupold scope was calibrated for .223 Remington rounds, so other scopes were often substituted.
* '''SP89''': ''Sportpistole M1989''. Semi-automatic only version of the MP5K designed for civilian use. It lacked a vertical foregrip to make it compliant with the [[National Firearms Act]]. It was made from 1989 to 1994.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}
* '''SP5K''':  First introduced in 2016, the SP5K is an updated version of the SP89. It features a Picatinny rail mounted on the top of the receiver for mounting accessories. As with the SP89, it is semi-automatic only and the forward handguard does not have a vertical foregrip.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/sport/full-size-compact/sp5k/sp5k/product-overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Middleton''' (1717 – June 13, 1784) was a [[Planter (American South)|planter]] and public official from [[South Carolina]]. A member of the colonial legislature, during the [[American Revolution]] he attended the [[Continental Congress]] and served as that body's [[President of the Continental Congress|presiding officer]] for a few days in 1774. He left Congress before it [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared independence]]. Back in South Carolina, he served as president of the provincial congress and senator in the newly created state government. After his capture by the British in 1780, he accepted defeat and returned to the status of a British subject until the end of the war.

==Early life and family==
Henry Middleton was born in 1717 near [[Charles Town, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Province of South Carolina]], to [[Arthur Middleton (1681–1737)|Arthur Middleton]] (1681–1737) and Susan Amory (1690-1722), on the family plantation, &quot;The Oaks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot;&gt;John G. Van Deusen, &quot;Middleton, Henry&quot;, ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (revised edition, New York: Scribner's, 1961), 6:600.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's father Arthur Middleton was a wealthy planter who had served as an acting governor of South Carolina. Henry was educated in England before returning to South Carolina to inherit his father's plantation. He became one of the largest landowners in the colony, owning {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} and about 800 slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

Middleton married Mary Williams in 1741, with whom he would have five sons and seven daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt; After Mary’s death in 1761, Middleton would go on to marry twice more, second to Maria Henrietta Bull (in 1762) and third to Lady Mary McKenzie (in 1776).&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

==Public offices==
Middleton served in a variety of public offices in South Carolina. He was a [[justice of the peace]] and a  member of the [[Commons House of Assembly]], where he was elected speaker in 1747, 1754, and 1755.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt; He was a member of provincial council, but resigned in 1770 in opposition to British policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

In 1774, at the outset of the [[American Revolution]], Middleton was selected as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]]. He served as that body's [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] during the last few days of the [[First Continental Congress]], following the departure of [[Peyton Randolph]].&lt;ref&gt;Calvin C. Jillson and Rick K. Wilson, ''Congressional Dynamics: Structure, Coordination, and Choice in the First American Congress, 1774–1789'' (Stanford University Press, 1994), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Middleton opposed declaring independence from Great Britain, and resigned from the [[Second Continental Congress]] in February 1776 when more radical delegates began pushing for independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt; He was succeeded in Congress by his son, [[Arthur Middleton]] (1742–1787), who was more radical than his father and became a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

After Middleton's return to South Carolina, he was elected president of the [[provincial congress]] and, beginning on November 16, 1775, served on the [[council of safety]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt; In 1776, he and his son Arthur helped frame a temporary state constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt; In 1779, he became a state senator in the new government.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

When Charleston was [[Siege of Charleston|captured by the British]] in 1780, Middleton accepted defeat and status as a British subject. This reversal apparently did not damage his reputation in the long run, due to his previous support of the Revolution, and he did not suffer the fate of having his estates confiscated, as many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] did after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Middleton died on June 13, 1784 in Charleston.

His grandson, also named [[Henry Middleton (governor)|Henry]] (1770–1846), had a long career in politics. He was [[List of Governors of South Carolina|Governor of South Carolina]] (1810–1812), [[U.S. Representative]] (1815–1819), and the minister to Russia (1820–1830). Some of Middleton's children married into prominent families. Daughter Henrietta married Governor [[Edward Rutledge]], Sarah was the first wife of [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], and his daughter Susannah married [[John Parker (Continental Congress)|John Parker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot; /&gt;

'''Ham''' is [[pork]] that has been [[food preservation|preserved]] through [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], or [[Curing (food preservation)|wet curing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Cancer Research Fund|title=Red and processed meats and cancer prevention|url=http://www.wcrf-uk.org/cancer_prevention/recommendations/meat_and_cancer.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was traditionally made only from the hind leg of [[swine]], and referred to that specific [[cut of pork]].&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;&quot;Bacon: Bacon and Ham Curing&quot; in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 2, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Ham is made around the world, including a number of highly coveted regional specialties, such as [[Westphalian ham]] and some varieties of [[Jamón|Spanish ''jamón'']]. Technically a [[processed meat]], &quot;ham&quot; may refer to a product which has been through mechanical re-forming.

The precise nature of meat termed &quot;ham&quot; is controlled in a number of areas, often by statute, including the United States and European Union. In addition, numerous ham products have specific geographical naming protection, such as [[Prosciutto di Parma]] and Prosciutto Toscano PDO in Europe, and [[Smithfield ham]] in the US.

== Definition ==
The preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with [[Cato the Elder]] writing about the &quot;salting of hams&quot; in his ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' tome around 160 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|volume=1|issue=2–3|date=December 1947|pages=269–274|title=The Action of Salts and other Substances Used in the Curing of Bacon and Ham|last=Callow|first=EH|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=766980|doi=10.1079/bjn19470037|pmid=18907930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are claims that the Chinese were the first people to mention the production of cured ham.&lt;ref name=zeuthen&gt;{{cite book|title=Meat Fermentation Worldwide: History and Principles|last=Zeuthen|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ie2IxsLTqfgC&amp;pg=PA3|isbn=978-0-470-37634-8|date=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larousse Gastronomique]] claims an origin from [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Hamlyn|isbn=978-0-600-62042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certainly well established by the Roman period, as evidenced by an import trade from Gaul mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in his writings.&lt;ref name=zeuthen /&gt;

The modern word &quot;ham&quot; is derived from the [[Old English]] ''ham'' or ''hom'' meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant &quot;crooked&quot;. It began to refer to the [[cut of pork]] derived from the hind leg of a [[swine]] around the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Brown, Lesley|publisher=Oxford University press|location=Oxford|year=2007|edition=Sixth|volume=II|page=3611}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preservation methods include [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], and [[salt-cured meat|salting]].

Because of the preservation process, ham is a compound foodstuff or ingredient, being made up of the original meat, as well as the remnants of the preserving agent(s), such as salt, but it is still recognised as a food in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Food Standards Agency Scotland|page=31|title=Labelling and Composition of Meat Products: Guidance Notes|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/meatproductguidancescot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labeling ===
In many countries the term is now protected by statute, with a specific definition. For instance, in the United States, the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) says that &quot;the word 'ham', without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/9/317.8|title=9 CFR 317.8 – False or misleading labeling or practices generally; specific prohibitions and requirements for labels and containers|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling. For instance, in the United States, a &quot;smoked&quot; ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a [[smokehouse]] or an atomized spray of [[liquid smoke]] such that the product appearance is equivalent; a &quot;[[hickory]]-smoked&quot; ham must have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting &quot;smoke flavor&quot; is not legal grounds for claiming the ham was &quot;smoked&quot;; these are labeled &quot;smoke flavor added&quot;. Hams can only be labeled &quot;honey-cured&quot; if honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least 3% of the formula, and has a discernible effect on flavor. So-called &quot;lean&quot; and &quot;extra lean&quot; hams must adhere to maximum levels of fat and [[cholesterol]] per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of product.

Ham re-formed from smaller pieces into a larger block also has to be labeled in many jurisdictions.

== Methods ==
Ham is produced by preserving and flavoring raw pork by [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], or [[Curing (food preservation)|wet curing]]. Besides salt, several ingredients may be used to obtain flavoring and preservation, from black pepper (e.g. Prosciutto Toscano PDO) to the precious saffron (e.g. the &quot;Zafferano di San Gimignano PDO&quot; in the esteemed Golden Ham).

=== Salting ===
[[File:ProsciuttoSeaSalt.JPG|thumb|right|Sea salt being added to raw pork leg as part of a dry cure process]]Traditional dry cure hams may use only salt as the curative agent, such as with San Daniele or Parma hams, although this is comparatively rare.&lt;ref name=meat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meatsandsausages.com/sausage-making/curing/methods|title=Curing Methods|publisher=Meat and Sausages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process involves cleaning the raw meat, covering it in salt (for about one month for Parma ham) while it is gradually pressed – draining all the blood. In Tuscan Ham (Prosciutto Toscano PDO) different spices and herbs (from garlic to black pepper, from juniper to laurel) are added to salt during this step. Specific ingredients may be used to enhance flavour and taste during this step, e.g. pure saffron in the Golden Ham from San Gimignano (Italy). The hams are then washed and hung in a dark, temperature-regulated place until dry. It is then hung to air for another period of time.

The duration of the curing process varies by the type of ham, with Serrano ham curing in 9–12 months, Parma hams taking more than 12 months, and Iberian ham taking up to 2 years to reach the desired flavour characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=European Food Research and Technology|year=2001|volume=213|issue=2|pages=83–87|title=Dipeptidyl peptidase activities along the processing of Serrano dry-cured ham|first1=Miguel Angel|last1=Sentandreu|first2=Fidel|last2=Toldrá|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002170100355#page-1|doi=10.1007/s002170100355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dry cured hams, such as the [[Jinhua ham]], take approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;{{Citation|first=G.H. |last=Zhou |first2=G.M. |last2=Zhao |title=Biochemical changes during processing of traditional Jinhua ham |journal=Meat Science |year=2007 |pages=114–120|issue=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern dry cure hams also use [[nitrite]]s (either [[sodium nitrite|sodium]] or [[potassium nitrate|potassium]]), which are added along with the salt, although following a similar methodology. The nitrites deliver a distinctive pink or red tinge to the meat, as well as imparting flavour. The amount and mixture of salt and nitrites used have an effect on the shrinkage of the meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Food Science|title=Effect of salt, phosphates and other curing ingredients on shrinkage of lean pork meat and quality of smoked processed ham|first1=Eugen|last1=Wierbicki|first2=John J|last2=Howker|year=1976|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1116–1121|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1976.tb14399.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1976.tb14399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sodium nitrite]] is used because it prevents bacterial growth and, in a reaction with the meat's [[myoglobin]], gives the product a desirable dark red color. Because of the toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose of nitrite for humans is about 22&amp;nbsp;mg per kg body weight), some areas specify a maximum allowable content of nitrite in the final product. Under certain conditions, especially during cooking, nitrites in meat can react with degradation products of [[amino acid]]s, forming [[nitrosamine]]s, which are known [[carcinogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The dry curing of ham involves a number of [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions. The enzymes involved are [[proteinase]]s  ([[cathepsin]]s – [[Cathepsin B|B]], [[Cathepsin D|D]], [[Cathepsin H|H]] &amp; [[Cathepsin L1|L]], and [[calpain]]s) and [[exopeptidase]]s ([[peptidase]] and [[aminopeptidase]]).&lt;ref name=toldra&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toldrá|first1=Fidel|last2=Flores|first2=Mónica|title=The Role of Muscle Proteases and Lipases in Flavor Development During the Processing of Dry-Cured Ham|journal=Critical Reviews in Food SCience and Nutrition|year=1998|volume=38|issue=4|pages=351–352|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408699891274237#.UlauaVNr2BI|doi=10.1080/10408699891274237}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes cause [[proteolysis]] of muscle tissue, which creates large numbers of small [[peptide]]s and free [[amino acid]]s, while the [[adipose]] tissue undergoes [[lipolysis]] to create free fatty acids.&lt;ref name=toldra /&gt; Salt and phosphates act as strong inhibitors of [[proteolysis|proteolytic activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Meat Science|title=Effect of curing salt and phosphate on the activity of porcine muscle proteases|year=1989|volume=24|issue=4|pages=241–249|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0309174089900429|last1=Sárraga|first1=Carmen|last2=Gil|first2=Marta|first3=Jacint|last3=Arnau|first4=Josep M|last4=Monfort|doi=10.1016/0309-1740(89)90042-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal factors influencing enzymatic activity include age, weight, and breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Carmen|last1=Sárraga|first2=Marta|last2=Gil|first3=José Antonio|last3=García-Regueiro|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|title=Comparison of calpain and cathepsin (B,L and D) activities during dry-cured ham processing from heavy and large white pigs|volume=62|issue=1|pages=71–75|date=1993|doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740620110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the process itself, conditions such as temperature, duration, water content, [[redox potential]], and salt content all have an effect.&lt;ref name=toldra /&gt;

The salt content in dry-cured ham varies throughout a piece of meat, with gradients determinable through sampling and testing or non-invasively through [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Meat Science|title=Salt distribution in dry-cured ham measured by computed tomography and image analysis|last1=Vestergaard|first1=Christian|first2=Søren G|last2=Erbou|first3=Torunn|last3=Thauland|first4=Jens|last4=Adler-Nissen|first5=Per|last5=Berg|volume=69|issue=1|date=January 2005|pages=9–15|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2004.06.002|pmid=22062634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoking ===
{{See also|Smoking (cooking)}}
Ham can also be preserved through the smoking method, in which the meat is placed in a smokehouse (or equivalent) to be cured by the action of smoke.

The main flavor compounds of smoked ham are [[guaiacol]], and its 4-, 5-, and 6-methyl derivatives as well as 2,6-dimethylphenol. These compounds are produced by thermal breakdown (i.e., combustion) of lignin, a major constituent of wood used in the smokehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkowski, Reiner; Ruther, Joachim; Drinda, Heike; Rafiei-Taghanaki, Foroozan &quot;Formation of smoke flavor compounds by thermal lignin degradation&quot; ACS Symposium Series (Flavor Precursors), 1992, volume 490, pp 232–243. {{ISBN|9780841222229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wet curing ===
{{See also|brining}}
Wet curing (also known as brining) involves the immersion of the meat in a [[brine]], sometimes with other ingredients such as sugar also added for flavour. Meat is submerged in the brine for around 3–14 days, during which time the meat needs to be kept submerged, and the brine mixture agitated periodically to prevent separation of the ingredients.&lt;ref name=meat /&gt;

Wet curing also has the effect of increasing volume and weight of the finished product, by about 4%.

The wet curing process can also be replicated by using mechanical pumping using needles and curing solution. This can be quicker, increase the weight of the finished product by more than immersion wet curing, and ensure a more even distribution of salt through the meat. This process is quicker than traditional wet cure, normally being completed between a few days and a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Applied Microbiology|date=September 1958|title=The occurrence and significance of a motile microorganism of the Genus Lactobacillus in ham curing brines|last1=Deibel|first1=RH|last2=Niven|first2=CF|volume=6|issue=5|pages=323–327|pmc=1057423|pmid=13571973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ham is typically used in its sliced form, often as a filling for sandwiches and similar foods, such as in the [[ham sandwich]] and [[ham and cheese sandwich]]. Other variations include toasted sandwiches such as the [[croque-monsieur]] and the [[Cuban sandwich|Cubano]].

Preserved ham can be cooked (although there is no requirement), and usually requires washing in water to remove salt. Whole fresh pork leg is also served cooked as [[gammon (meat)|gammon]], known as ham in the United States.

== Health effects ==
As a processed meat, there has been concern over the health effects of ham consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Processed meat 'early death' link|last=Gallagher|first=James|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21682779}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis study from 2012 has shown a statistically relevant correlation between processed meat consumption and the risk of [[pancreatic cancer]], with an increase in consumption of {{convert|50|g|oz}} per day leading to a 19% increase in risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Cancer|year=2012|volume=106|pages=603–607|last1=Larsson|first1=SC|last2=Wolk|first2=A|title=Red and processed meat consumption and risk of pancreatic cancer: meta-analysis of prospective studies|url=http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v106/n3/full/bjc2011585a.html|issue=3|doi=10.1038/bjc.2011.585|pmid=22240790|pmc=3273353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Laurens''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|March 6,|1724|February 24, 1723&lt;!--OS New Year began March 25--&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}}December 8, 1792) was an [[United States|American]] merchant, slave trader, and rice [[Planter (American South)|planter]] from [[South Carolina]] who became a political leader during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. A delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]], Laurens succeeded [[John Hancock]] as [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] of the Congress. He was a signatory to the [[Articles of Confederation]] and President of the Continental Congress when the Articles were passed on November 15, 1777.

Laurens had earned great wealth as a partner in the largest [[slave trading|slave-trading]] house in North America, Austin and Laurens. In the 1750s alone, this Charleston firm oversaw the sale of more than 8,000 enslaved Africans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf Report of the Brown University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Laurens was for a time Vice-President of South Carolina and a diplomat to the Netherlands during the Revolutionary War. He was captured at sea and imprisoned for some time by the British in the Tower of London.

His son [[John Laurens]] was a colonel in the [[Continental Army]].

==Early life and education==
Henry Laurens’s forebears were [[Huguenots]] who fled France after the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685. Henry’s grandfather Andre Laurens left earlier, in 1682, and eventually made his way to America, settling first in New York City and then Charleston, South Carolina. Andre’s son John married Hester (or Esther) Grasset, also a Huguenot refugee. Henry was their third child and eldest son. John Laurens became a saddler, and his business eventually grew to be the largest of its kind in the colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Henry_Laurens.aspx | accessed=2013-12-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1744 John Laurens sent Henry to London to augment the young man's business training.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;/&gt; This took place in the company of [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillespie2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Joanna Bowen|title=The Life and Times of Martha Laurens Ramsay, 1759–1811|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAjMOu1qnE0C&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=20 July 2017|year=2001|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=9781570033735|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Laurens died in 1747, bequeathing twenty-three-year-old Henry a considerable estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
He married Eleanor Ball, also of a South Carolina rice planter family, on June 25, 1750.  They had thirteen children, many of whom died in infancy or childhood.  Eleanor died in 1770, one month after giving birth to their last child.  Laurens took their three sons to England for their education, encouraging their oldest, [[John Laurens]], to study law. The young Laurens returned to the United States in 1776, at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Political career==

Laurens served in the militia, as did most able-bodied men in his time.  He rose to the rank of Lt. Colonel in the [[Anglo-Cherokee War|campaigns]] against the [[Cherokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in 1757–1761, during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]).

1757 also marked the first year he was elected to the colonial assembly. Laurens was elected again every year but one until the Revolution replaced the assembly with a state Convention as an interim government.  The year he missed was 1773, when he visited England to arrange for his sons' educations.  He was named to the colony's Council in 1764 and 1768, but declined both times.  In 1772 he joined the [[American Philosophical Society]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and carried on extensive correspondence with other members.

As the [[American Revolution]] neared, Laurens was at first inclined to support reconciliation with the [[United Kingdom|British Crown]]. But as conditions deteriorated, he came to fully support the American position.  When Carolina began to create a revolutionary government, Laurens was elected to the Provincial Congress, which first met on January 9, 1775.  He was president of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], and presiding officer of that congress from June until March 1776.  When South Carolina installed a fully independent government, he served as the Vice President of South Carolina from March 1776 to June 27, 1777.

Henry Laurens was first named a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] on January 10, 1777.  He served in the Congress from until 1780.  He was the [[President of the Continental Congress]] from November 1, 1777 to December 9, 1778.

In the fall of 1779, the Congress named Laurens their minister to the [[Netherlands]]. In early 1780 he took up that post and successfully negotiated Dutch support for the war.  But on his return voyage to Amsterdam that fall, the British frigate {{HMS|Vestal|1779|2}} intercepted his ship, the continental [[Packet (sea transport)|packet]] ''Mercury'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tuchman | first = Barbara | title = First Salute: A View of the American Revolution | publisher = Random House LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; off the banks of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Although his dispatches were tossed in the water, they were retrieved by the British, who discovered the draft of a possible U.S.-Dutch treaty prepared in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1778 by [[William Lee (diplomat)|William Lee]] and the Amsterdam banker [[Jean de Neufville]].&lt;ref&gt;https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-03-02-0031&lt;/ref&gt;  This prompted Britain to declare war on the [[Dutch Republic]], it becoming known as the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]].

The British charged Laurens with treason, transported him to England, and imprisoned him in the [[Tower of London]] (he is the only American to have been held prisoner in the Tower).  His imprisonment was protested by the Americans.  In the field, most captives were regarded as prisoners of war, and while conditions were frequently appalling, prisoner exchanges and mail privileges were accepted practice. During his imprisonment, Laurens was assisted by Richard Oswald, his former business partner and the principal owner of [[Bunce Island]].  Oswald argued on Laurens' behalf to the British government. Finally, on December 31, 1781 he was released in exchange for General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] and completed his voyage to Amsterdam. He helped raise funds for the American effort.

In a late skirmish during the war, Laurens' oldest son John was killed in 1782. He had supported enlisting and freeing slaves for the war effort and suggested to his father that he begin with the 40 he stood to inherit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massey&quot;/&gt;  He urged his father to free their slaves. Yet, although conflicted, Henry Laurens never manumitted his 260 slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massey&quot;&gt;[http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2003_winter_spring/slavery_liberty.htm Gregory D.

In 1783 Laurens was sent to [[Paris]] as one of the Peace Commissioners for the negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].  While he was not a signatory of the primary treaty, he was instrumental in reaching the secondary accords that resolved issues related to the Netherlands and [[Spain]].  [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]], a former partner of Laurens in the slave trade, was the principal negotiator for the British during the Paris peace talks.

Laurens generally retired from public life in 1784.  He was sought for a return to the Continental Congress, the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 and the state assembly, but he declined all of these positions. He did serve in the state convention of 1788, where he voted to ratify the [[United States Constitution]].

==Later events==
The British occupying forces from Charleston had burned the main home at [[Mepkin Abbey|Mepkin]] during the war. When Laurens and his family returned in 1784, they lived in an outbuilding while the [[great house]] was rebuilt. He lived on the estate the rest of his life, working to recover the estimated £40,000 that the revolution had cost him (equivalent to about $3,500,000 in 2000 values).

==Death and cremation==
Laurens died on December 8, 1792, at his estate, Mepkin. In his will he stated he wished to be [[Cremation|cremated]], and his ashes be interred at his estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vZy1RUu59Ko/UFp3Q2CjObI/AAAAAAAAA_M/tjtsoVR-27M/s1600/laurens+grave.jpg Laurens cenotaph at Mepkin]&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported{{By whom|date=April 2017}} that his was the first formal cremation in United States. Afterward, the estate passed through several hands.  Large portions of the estate still exist and are used today as a [[Trappist]] abbey.

[[File:HOTOL.JPG|thumb|An artist's depiction of HOTOL]]
'''HOTOL''', for '''Horizontal Take-Off and Landing''', was a 1980s [[United Kingdom|British]] design for a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) [[spaceplane]] that was to be powered by an [[airbreathing jet engine]]. Development was being conducted by a consortium led by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[British Aerospace]] (BAe).

Designed as a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) reusable winged launch vehicle, HOTOL was to be fitted with a unique air-breathing engine, the RB545 or Swallow, that was under development by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The propellant for the engine technically consisted of a combination of liquid [[hydrogen]]/liquid [[oxygen]]; however, it was to employ a new means of dramatically reducing the amount of oxidizer needed to be carried on board by utilising atmospheric oxygen as the spacecraft climbed through the lower atmosphere. Since propellant typically represents the majority of the takeoff weight of a rocket, HOTOL was to be considerably smaller than normal pure-rocket designs, roughly the size of a medium-haul airliner such as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]/MD-80.

While HOTOL's [[proof-of-concept]] design study was being carried out, attempts were made by both industry and the British government to establish international cooperation to develop, produce, and deploy the spacecraft. In spite of American interest in the programme, there was little appetite amongst the members of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and the British government was not prepared to depart from ESA cooperation. Additionally, technical issues were encountered, and there were allegations that comparisons with alternative launch systems such as conventional rocket vehicle using similar construction techniques failed to show much advantage to HOTOL. In 1989, funding for the project ended. The termination of development work on HOTOL led to the formation of [[Reaction Engines Limited]] (REL) to develop and produce [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]], a proposed spacecraft based on HOTOL technologies, including its engine.

==Development==
===Origins===
The ideas behind HOTOL originated from work done by British Engineer [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] in the field of precooled jet engines. Bond had specifically performed this research with the intention of producing a viable engine for powering a space [[launch system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;3rocket&quot;&gt;{{cite av media |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mqv45 |title=BBC Four: The Three Rocketeers |publisher = [[BBC]] |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), who was Europe's principal [[satellite]]-builder, began studying a prospective new launch system with the aim of providing launch costs that were 20 per cent of the American [[Space Shuttle]] operated by [[NASA]].&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt; BAe became aware of work by British engine manufacturer [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] on a suitable engine, and soon conceived of an unmanned, fully reuseable [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) winged spaceplane as a launch vehicle.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt;

Thus, the project had soon became a joint venture between BAe and Rolls-Royce, led by [[John Scott-Scott (engineer)|John Scott-Scott]] and [[Bob Parkinson (aerospace engineer)|Dr Bob Parkinson]].&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;&gt;Moxon 1986, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, there was an ambition to 'Europeanise' the project and to involve other nations in its development and manufacture as it was recognised that an estimated £4 billion would be needed to fund full-scale development.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt; In August 1984, BAe unveiled a public display of the HOTOL satellite launcher project and released details on its proposed operations.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;

In December 1984, a [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) memorandum noted that [[West Germany]] was interested in the program, while [[France]] had adopted a critical attitude towards HOTOL, which the ministry viewed as potentially due to it being seen as a competitor to French-led projects. According to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Minister of Trade and Industry]] [[Geoffrey Pattie]], French diplomatic pressure to gather support for its own proposed [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] space vehicle had inadvertently generated support and interest amongst [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) members in the HOTOL project.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; Despite this climate of tentative interest and possible European support, there was a general attitude of reluctance within the British government to take the lead on a new space launcher.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;

===American interest and design study===
In March 1985, there were claims that Rolls-Royce was in the process of conducting [[Licensed production|licensing]] talks for HOTOL engine technology with American propulsion company [[Rocketdyne]].&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; In April 1985, Pattie wrote to [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]] to propose a two-year £3 million [[proof of concept]] study be performed under a [[public-private partnership]] arrangement, consisting of £1 million provided by the UK government and the remainder being financed by Rolls-Royce and BAe themselves. Pattie reasoned that the project would serve Britain's &quot;strategic capability, and that tests of key technologies could foster international collaboration.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; According to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], the support of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defense]] (MoD) was critical as the design of HOTOL's engine had been classified.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt;

In July 1985, Rolls-Royce's technical director Gordon Lewis stated that the firm sought the involvement of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]'s (RAE) propulsion group, and that Rolls-Royce was not prepared to invest its own funds into engine development for HOTOL.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; By the second half of 1985, work had commenced on the two-year concept-of-proof study.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; Early on, there was considerable pressure to demonstrate the project's feasibility and credibility in advance of final decisions being taken by the ESA on the Hermes and what would become the [[Ariane 5]] launch system, thus the work concentrated on the validation of critical technologies involved.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt;

By November 1985, DTI and RAE discussions noted that Rolls-Royce were seeking American data on [[ramjet]] technology to support their work on the engine, which it referred to by the name ''Swallow''.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; Reportedly, the [[United States Air Force]] were interested in the technology used in the Swallow engine for its own purposes.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt; In November 1985, discussions between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Minister without portfolio]] [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s scientific advisor [[George A. Keyworth, II|George Keyworth]] noted American interest in collaboration on developing [[hypersonic]] vehicles such as HOTOL, and that a prototype could be flying as early as 1990.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;

According to British government files, neither BAe not the MoD were enthusiastic for the prospects of American involvement in the programme, expressing reluctance out of a belief that the outcome of such a move could result in the UK becoming a junior member in a project that it once led.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; There was also a belief that if Britain chose to pair up with the United States, it would find itself frozen out of work on future European launchers.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt; However, Rolls-Royce viewed transatlantic cooperation as necessary.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; BAe's head of future business Peter Conchie stated that, if possible, HOTOL should become a part of the European space framework.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38&quot;/&gt; In early 1986, the British government formally approved the two-year study.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;

===Problems and criticism===
In December 1984, project management consultant David Andrews issued an eight-page critique of the programme, noting that the design was optimised for the ascent while exposing itself to extended thermal loads during descent due to a low level of [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]. He also claimed that the vehicle offered no capability that was not already available; BAe responded that the criticisms made had been answered.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; In April 1985, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s research and development department deputy controller James Barnes claimed that HOTOL lacked a justification, and that there was no defence requirement for such vehicles. He also noted that the &quot;engineering problems are considerable&quot; and that it was unlikely to enter service until the 2020s; Barnes also observed the HOTOL engine to be &quot;ingenious&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;

In November 1985, the RAE issued an assessment of HOTOL's study proposal; the organisation believe that HOTOL would take up to 20 years to develop, rather than the 12-year timetable that had been envisioned by industry. The RAE also projected that the project would have an estimated total cost of £5 billion (as of its value in 1985), £750 million of which would be required in a six-year definition phase and an estimated £25 million in a pre-definition feasibility study.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt;

During development, it was found that the comparatively heavy rear-mounted engine moved the centre of mass of the vehicle rearwards. This meant that the vehicle had to be designed to push the centre of drag as far rearward as possible to ensure stability during the entire flight regime. Redesign of the vehicle to do this required a large mass of hydraulic systems, which cost a significant proportion of the payload, and made the economics unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Science/021M-C1379X0005XX-0012V0|title=Oral history of British science|date=2010-11-08|publisher=British Library|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some of the analysis seemed to indicate that similar technology applied to a pure rocket approach would give approximately the same performance at less cost.

===Shutdown===
By 1989, the outlook for HOTOL had become bleak; from the onset of the project, support between the British government and industrial partners had been uneven, while the United States had emerged as the only foreign nation that showed willingness to contribute to the programme,&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; in part because of the secrecy surrounding the program. There was little prospect for European involvement, the ESA having elected to pursue development of what would become the [[Ariane 5]], a conventional space launch system.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; Rolls-Royce withdrew from the project, judging the eventual market for the engine was unlikely to be large enough to repay the development costs&lt;ref name=&quot;Spaceflight 1993&quot;/&gt;.  The British government declined to offer further funding for HOTOL. The project was almost at the end of its design phase while much of the plans remained in a speculative state; the craft was reportedly still dogged with aerodynamic problems and operational disadvantages at this point.

===Successors===
A cheaper redesign, '''Interim HOTOL''' or '''HOTOL 2''', which was to be launched from the back of a modified [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']] [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]], was promoted by BAe in 1991; however, this proposal was rejected as well. The design for Interim HOTOL was to have dispensed with an air-breathing engine cycle and was designed to use a more conventional mix of LOX and liquid hydrogen as fuel instead.

In 1989, HOTOL co-creator [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] and engineers John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill formed [[Reaction Engines Limited]] (REL) which has since been working on a new air-breahing engine, [[SABRE (rocket engine)|SABRE]], which used alterative designs to work around (and improve upon) the Rolls-Royce patents, and the [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]] vehicle intended to solve the problems of HOTOL. They first published these engine and spacecraft concepts in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;Skylon 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Richard|last1= Varvill |first2= Alan |last2= Bond |title= SKYLON: a Key Element of a Future Space Transportation System |date= May 1993 |pages= 162-166 |issue= 5 |volume= 35 |magazine= [[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |publisher= [[British Interplanetary Society]] |issn= 0038-6340 |place= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been developing the core technologies, particularly the engine and its frost-controlled precooler; initially supported by private funding, but latterly with support from the [[European Space Agency]], the [[British National Space Centre]], the [[United Kingdom Space Agency]], BAe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/bae-takes-stake-reaction-engines-hypersonic-development |title=BAE Takes Stake In Reaction Engines Hypersonic Development |last1=Norris |first1=Guy |date=1 November 2015 |website=aviationweek.com |publisher=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]]. {{As of | 2017}} REL plan to demonstrate a flight-ready precooler operating under simulated flight conditions in 2018, and statically test a demonstration engine core in 2020.

==Design==
===Overview===
HOTOL was envisioned as an unmanned, fully reuseable [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) winged spaceplane. The unmanned craft was intended to put a payload of around 7 to 8 [[tonne]]s in orbit, at 300&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt; It was intended to take off from a runway, mounted on the back of a large rocket-boosted trolley that would help get the craft up to &quot;working speed&quot;. The engine was intended to switch from jet propulsion to pure rocket propulsion at 26–32&amp;nbsp;km high, by which time the craft would be travelling at [[Mach number|Mach]] 5 to 7. After reaching [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), HOTOL was intended to re-enter the atmosphere and glide down to land on a conventional runway (approx 1,500 metres minimum). Only a single payload would have been carried at a time as BAe had judged this to be more economic as it removed any need for satellite interfacing and allowed for missions to be tailored to individual requirements.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt;

During its high-altitude phase, its [[flight control system]] would have been linked to ground stations and to space-based [[Global Positioning System|global navigation system]] navigation, while [[radar]] would have been used during the take-off and landing phases. In additional to the placing of satellites into [[geosynchronous orbit]] or LOE, HOTOL was also projected as being able to also perform the retrieval of satellites and hardware from LOE.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt; BAe promotional material depicts HOTOL docking with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), a feat that the company claimed would have required manned operate as automated systems were not capable of performing such docking manoeuvres at that time.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt; HOTOL was designed to conduct fully automated unmanned flights; however, it had been intended at a later stage to potentially re-introduce a pilot. Manned operations would have required the installation of a dedicated [[Cabin pressurization|pressurised]] module within the payload bay.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt;

As designed, HOTOL would have been 62 metres long, 12.8 metres high, a fuselage diameter of 5.7 meters and a wingspan of 19.7 metres.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt; It featured a wing design that had been derived from that of [[Concorde]]; its large area resulted in relatively low wing loading, which would have resulted in lower reentry temperatures (never rising above 1,400&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt; Built out of [[carbon composite]] materials, there would have been no need for the use of insulating tiles akin to those that comprised the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]]. The internally stowed landing gear would have been too small to carry the weight of the fully fuelled rocket, so emergency landings would have required the fuel to be dumped.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;&gt;Moxon 1986, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine===
The RB545, which was given the name &quot;Swallow&quot; by its manufacturer, British engine maker [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], was an air-breathing rocket engine.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;/&gt; It would have functioned as an integrated dual-role powerplant, having been capable of air-breathing while operating within the [[atmosphere]] and operating in a similar manner to that of a [[rocket]] when having attained close to and within LEO.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 38 40&quot;&gt;Moxon 1986, pp. 38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This engine would have also been capable of powering the spacecraft to [[hypersonic]] speeds. It was a crucial element of the programme, having been publicly attributed as having been &quot;the heart of Hotol's very low launch costs&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;moxon 40&quot;/&gt;

The exact details of this engine were covered by the [[Official Secrets Act]] of the United Kingdom; consequently, there is relatively little public information about its development and on its operation. However, material was later declassified when government policy changed to prevent the keeping of secret patents without an attributed justification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Eminent-scientists/021M-C1379X0005XX-0010V0 Dr Bob Parkinson discusses HOTOL in an oral history interview recorded for the [[National Life Stories]] project [[Oral History of British Science]] at the [[British Library]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spaceflight 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Mark |last1= Hempsell |title= HOTOL's Secret Engines Revealed |date= May 1993 |pages= 168-172 |issue= 5 |volume= 35 |magazine= [[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |publisher= [[British Interplanetary Society]] |issn= 0038-6340 |place= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the atmosphere, air is taken in through two vertically mounted [[Intake ramp]]s, then the flow would be split, passing the correct amount to the precoolers, and the excess to spill ducts. Hydrogen from the fuel tanks would be passed through two [[Precooled jet engine|heat exchangers to precool the air]] prior to entering a high overall pressure-ratio [[turbojet]]-like engine cycle — the heated hydrogen driving a turbine to compress and feed the cooled air into the rocket engine, where it was combusted with some of the hydrogen used to cool the air. The majority of the remaining hot hydrogen was released from the back of the engine, with a small amount drawn off to reheat the air in the spill ducts in a ramjet arrangement to produce &quot;negative intake momentum drag.&quot;{{efn|due to the split in responsibilities of the HOTOL project, Rolls-Royce were responsible for the engine, and BAe were responsible for the aerodynamics. When BAe wanted to add the ramjet it couldn't provide thrust, because that was the responsibility of the engine, so instead it was a mechanism for reducing drag&lt;ref name=&quot;Spaceflight 1993&quot;/&gt;}} These ramjets were typically depicted as two glowing red circles below the rocket engines in pictures of HOTOL.

To prevent the precoolers from icing up, the first precooler cooled the air to around 10 degrees above freezing point, to liquefy the water vapour in the air. Then LOX would have been injected into the airflow to drop the temperature to {{convert|50|C|F}} below freezing, flash freezing the water into microscopic ice crystals, sufficiently cold that they wouldn't melt due to kinetic heating if they struck the second precooler elements. A water trap could have been added after the first precooler if operating conditions resulted in an excess of moisture.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost1&quot;&gt;{{cite patent |country= GB |number= 2241537 |status= patent |title= Prevention of icing in the intakes of aerospace propulsors|invent= [[John Scott-Scott]] |invent2 = Bryan Belcher |invent3= [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] |assign1= Rolls Royce Plc |fdate= 23 March 1988 |pubdate= 1991-09-04 |gdate= 1992-08-12 |class= F02C7/047; F02C7/143; F28F19/006; Y02T50/675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was no longer possible to use the atmosphere for combustion, the RB545 would switch to using on-board liquid oxygen (LOX) to burn with the hydrogen as a high-efficiency hydrogen/oxygen rocket.&lt;ref name = &quot;secret 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/secret-files-reveal-us-interest-in-uk-hotol-spacepla-322955/ |title= Secret files reveal US interest in UK HOTOL spaceplane |publisher = [[Flight International]] |date = 23 February 2009 |first = Rob |last = Coppinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hammerhead sharks''' are a group of [[shark]]s in the family '''Sphyrnidae''', so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a &quot;hammer&quot; shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus '''''Sphyrna''''', while the [[winghead shark]] is placed in its own genus, '''''Eusphyra'''''. Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and [[continental shelves]]. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near [[Malpelo Island]] in [[Colombia]], [[Cocos Island]] off [[Costa Rica]], and near [[Molokai]] in [[Hawaii]]. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and [[eastern Africa]].

==Description==

Their bellies are white which allows them to blend into the ocean when viewed from the bottom and sneak up on their prey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharks-world.com/hammerhead_shark.html Hammerhead Shark]. Sharks-world.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Their heads have lateral projections which give them a hammer-like shape.

Hammerheads have disproportionately small mouths and seem to do a lot of bottom-hunting. They are also known to form [[shoaling and schooling|schools]] during the day, sometimes in groups of over 100. In the evening, like other sharks, they become solitary hunters. ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' explains that hammerheads can be found in warm tropical waters, but during the summer, hammerheads participate in a mass migration to search for cooler waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/hammerhead-shark/ | title= Hammerhead Shark| website= NationalGeographic.com| access-date= November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Since sharks do not have mineralized bones and rarely [[fossil]]ize, their teeth alone are commonly found as fossils. The hammerheads seem closely related to the [[carcharhinus|carcharhinid sharks]] that evolved during the mid-[[Tertiary]] period. According to DNA studies, the ancestor of the hammerheads probably lived in the [[Miocene]] epoch about 20 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100518113132.htm| title= Hammerhead shark study shows cascade of evolution affected size, head shape| date= May 19, 2010| website= ScienceDaily.com| publisher= [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] |access-date= November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[mitochondrial DNA]], a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the hammerhead sharks showed the [[winghead shark]] as its most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member. As the winghead shark has proportionately the largest &quot;hammer&quot; of the hammerhead sharks, this suggests that the first ancestral hammerhead sharks also had large hammers.&lt;ref name= Mutation&gt;{{cite web | first= R. Aidan| last= Martin| title=Origin and Evolution of the 'Hammer' | website= elasmo-research.org | url= http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/d_hh_origin.htm | accessdate=January 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cephalofoil ===

The theory has been advanced that the hammer-like shape of the head may have evolved (at least in part) to enhance the animal's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1242/jeb.032615 |title=Enhanced visual fields in hammerhead sharks |journal= Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=212|issue=24|pages=4010|year=2009|last1=McComb|first1=D. M. |last2= Tricas| first2= T. C.| last3= Kajiura| first3= S. M. | pmid=19946079}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The positioning of the eyes, mounted on the sides of the shark's distinctive hammer head, gives the shark good 360° vision in the vertical plane, meaning they can see above and below them at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= D. Michelle| last= McComb| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8376000/8376740.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hammerhead shark mystery solved | date=2009-11-27 | accessdate=2010-05-04|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World's Deadliest: Hammerhead Sharks|url = http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/worlds-deadliest/deadliest-hammerhead-shark|website = video.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate = 2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the head was previously thought to help the shark find food, aiding in close-quarters maneuverability and allowing sharp turning movement without losing stability.  However, it has been found that the unusual structure of its [[vertebra]]e was instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift.  From what is known about the [[winghead shark]], the shape of the hammer-head apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function.  Like all sharks, hammerheads have [[electroreception|electroreceptory]] sensory pores called [[ampullae of Lorenzini]]. By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna, hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.&lt;ref name= Hammer&gt;{{cite web | first= R. Aidan| last= Martin| title=If I Had a Hammer | work=Rodale's Scuba Diving |date= August 1993| url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/d_functions_of_hammer.htm | accessdate=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pores on the sharks head lead to sensory tubes.  These tubes detect electricity that living creatures give off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steven|title=Hammerheads and Other Sharks|date=2000|publisher=World Book, Inc|isbn=0716612100|pages=16|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Reproduction occurs only once  a year for hammerhead sharks, and usually occurs with the male shark biting the female shark violently until she agrees to mate with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;aquaticcommunity&quot;&gt;[http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/sharkfish/hammerheadshark.php Hammerhead Shark]. Aquatic Community. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The hammerhead sharks exhibit a [[viviparous]] mode of reproduction with females giving birth to live young. Like other sharks, [[fertilization]] is internal, with the male transferring [[sperm]] to the female through one of two [[intromittent organ]]s called [[clasper]]s. The developing [[embryo]]s are at first sustained by a [[yolk sac]]. When the supply of [[yolk]] is exhausted, the depleted yolk sac transforms into a structure analogous to a [[mammal]]ian [[placenta]] (called a &quot;yolk sac placenta&quot; or &quot;pseudoplacenta&quot;), through which the mother delivers sustenance until birth. Once the baby sharks are born, they are not taken care of by the parents in any way. Usually, a litter cosists of 12 to 15 pups, except for the great hammerhead, which gives birth to litters of 20 to 40 pups. These baby sharks huddle together and swim toward warmer water until they are old enough and large enough to survive on their own.&lt;ref name= aquaticcommunity /&gt;

In 2007, the [[bonnethead]] shark was found to be capable of [[asexual reproduction]] via [[parthenogenesis|automictic parthenogenesis]], in which a female's [[ovum]] fuses with a [[polar body]] to form a [[zygote]] without the need for a male. This was the first shark known to do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=DD |last2=Shivji |first2=MS |last3=Louis |first3=E |last4=Sommer |first4=J |last5=Fletcher |first5=H |last6=Prodöhl |first6=PA |title=Virgin birth in a hammerhead shark |volume=3 |issue=4 |date=2007-08-22 |journal=[[Biology Letters]]  |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0189 |pmc=2390672 |pmid=17519185 |pages=425–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Hammerhead sharks are known to eat a large range of prey including [[fish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]], [[crustaceans]], and other sharks. [[Stingrays]] are a particular favorite. These sharks are often found swimming along the bottom of the ocean, stalking their prey. Their unique heads are used as a weapon when hunting down prey. The hammerhead shark uses its head to pin down stingrays and eats the ray when the ray is weak and in shock.&lt;ref name= aquaticcommunity /&gt; The [[great hammerhead]], tending to be larger and more aggressive than most hammerheads, occasionally engages in [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]], eating other hammerhead sharks, including its own young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/sharks/species/Hammerhead.shtml |title= Great hammerhead shark| publisher= Enchanted Learning Software| website= EnchantedLearning.com| access-date= December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
[[Image:Hammerhead Atlantis.jpg|thumb|A hammerhead shark at [[Atlantis Paradise Island]]]]
Of the nine known species of hammerhead, only three are known to be particularly dangerous to humans: the [[Scalloped hammerhead|scalloped]], [[Great hammerhead|great]], and [[smooth hammerhead]]s. As of 2013, 33 attacks have been recorded, with no fatalities.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The great and the scalloped hammerheads are listed on the World Conservation Union's ([[IUCN]]) 2008 Red List as [[Endangered species|endangered]], whereas the smalleye hammerhead is listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. The status given to these sharks is as a result of overfishing and demand for their fins, an expensive delicacy. Among others, scientists expressed their concern about the plight of the scalloped hammerhead at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The young swim mostly in shallow waters along shores all over the world to avoid predators.

Shark fins are prized as a delicacy in certain countries in Asia (such as China), and overfishing is putting many hammerhead sharks at risk of extinction. Fishermen who harvest the animals typically cut off the fins and toss the remainder of the fish, which is often still alive, back into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/25/AR2011022505123.html | title= Panamanian officials find half ton of shark fins |agency= Associated Press | website= WashingtonPost.com | date= 2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, known as [[Shark finning|finning]], is lethal to the shark.

In Native Hawaiian culture, sharks are considered to be gods of the sea, protectors of humans, and cleaners of excessive ocean life. Some of these sharks are believed to be family members who died and have been reincarnated into shark form. However, some sharks are considered man-eaters, also known as ''niuhi''. These sharks include [[great white sharks]], [[tiger sharks]], and [[bull sharks]]. The hammerhead shark, also known as ''mano kihikihi'', is not considered a man-eater or ''niuhi''; it is considered to be one of the most respected sharks of the ocean, an ''aumakua''. Many Hawaiian families believe that they have an ''aumakua'' watching over them and protecting them from the ''niuhi''. The hammerhead shark is thought to be the birth animal of some children. Hawaiian children who are born with the hammerhead shark as an animal sign are believed to be warriors and are meant to sail the oceans. Hammerhead sharks rarely pass through the waters of [[Maui]], but many Maui natives believe that hammerhead sharks swimming by is a sign that the gods are watching over the families, and the oceans are clean and balanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moolelo.com/shark-respected.html Sharks Highly respected in Hawaiian Culture].

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Hall effect}}
The '''Hall effect''' is the production of a [[voltage]] difference (the '''Hall voltage''') across an [[electrical conductor]], transverse to an [[electric current]] in the conductor and to an applied [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by [[Edwin Hall]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents|author = [[Edwin Hall]]|journal = American Journal of Mathematics|volume = 2|year = 1879|pages = 287–92|url = http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|accessdate = 2008-02-28|doi = 10.2307/2369245|issue = 3|jstor = 2369245 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010116/http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|archivedate=2011-07-27 |ref = hallpdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For clarity, the original effect is sometimes called the '''ordinary Hall effect''' to distinguish it from other &quot;Hall effects&quot; which have different physical mechanisms.

The Hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced [[electric field]] to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field. It is a characteristic of  the material from which the conductor is made, since its value depends on the type, number, and properties of the [[charge carriers]] that constitute the current.

==Discovery==
The Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by [[Edwin Hall]] while he was working on his doctoral degree at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name=bridgeman-momoir&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridgeman|first=P. W.|title=Biographical Memoir of Edwin Herbert Hall|year=1939|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qWPFjF1DGJcJ:books.nap.edu/html/biomems/ehall.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiwi2QsmBBlJQ-CGCqOI-5jo7JVHR8KlVBUlYQg7o3jZTM3Hf2pSa3VeYGFgqCsepNg2dtCFeumBvFAX35h7vFrDq29vFqmPQsXXinsEp4aY1iC4-Tyws_IxDAUX0Gacg8xWCGQ&amp;sig=AHIEtbSYLSS-LvLf1yfIKBflgxKm-7Qwdw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  18 years before the [[electron]] was discovered, his measurements of the tiny effect produced in the apparatus he used were an experimental [[wikt:tour de force|tour de force]], published under the name &quot;On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hall Effect History|url = http://phareselectronics.com/products/hall-effect-sensors/hall-effect-history/|accessdate = 2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hall-Effect Sensors|last = Ramsden|first = Edward|publisher = Elsevier Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-7506-7934-3|location = |pages = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The Hall effect is due to the nature of the current in a conductor. Current consists of the movement of many small [[charge carrier]]s, typically [[electron]]s, [[Electron hole|holes]], [[ion]]s (see [[Electromigration]]) or all three. When a magnetic field is present, these charges experience a force, called the [[Lorentz force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeel.nist.gov/812/effe.htm|accessdate=2008-02-28|title=The Hall Effect|publisher=[[NIST]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight, 'line of sight' paths between collisions with impurities, [[phonons]], etc. However, when a  magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied, their paths between collisions are curved, thus moving charges accumulate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density across the Hall element, arising from a force that is perpendicular to both the 'line of sight' path and the applied magnetic field. The separation of charge establishes an [[electric field]] that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady [[electric potential]] is established for as long as the charge is flowing.

In [[classical electromagnetism]] electrons move in the opposite direction of the current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; (by [[Electric current#Conventions|convention]] &quot;current&quot; describes a theoretical &quot;hole flow&quot;). In some semiconductors it ''appears'' &quot;holes&quot; are actually flowing because the direction of the voltage is opposite to the derivation below.

[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Electrons.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for electrons. Initially, the electrons follow the curved arrow, due to the magnetic force. At some distance from the current-introducing contacts, electrons pile up on the left side and deplete from the right side, which creates an electric field ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; in the direction of the assigned V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is negative for some semi-conductors where &quot;holes&quot; appear to flow. In steady-state, ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; will be strong enough to exactly cancel out the magnetic force, thus the electrons follow the straight arrow (dashed).]]
[[File:Hall Sensor.webm|thumb|Animation showing the simplified principle]]
For a simple metal where there is only one type of [[charge carrier]] (electrons), the Hall voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be derived by using the [[Lorentz force]] and seeing that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the y-axis direction. Thus, the magnetic force on each electron in the y-axis direction is cancelled by a y-axis electrical force due to the buildup of charges. The &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt; term is the [[drift velocity]] of the current which is assumed at this point to be holes by convention. The &lt;math&gt;v_x B_z&lt;/math&gt; term is negative in the y-axis direction by the right hand rule.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q\left[\mathbf{E} + (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

In steady state, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;0 = E_y - v_x B_z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; is assigned in direction of y-axis, (and not with the arrow of the induced electric field &lt;math&gt;\xi_y&lt;/math&gt; as in the image (pointing in the &lt;math&gt;-y&lt;/math&gt; direction), which tells you where the field caused by the electrons is pointing).

In wires, electrons instead of holes are flowing, so &lt;math&gt;v_x \rightarrow -v_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q \rightarrow -q&lt;/math&gt;.  Also &lt;math&gt;E_y=-\frac{V_\mathrm{H}}{w}&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting these changes gives

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{H}= v_x B_z w&lt;/math&gt;

The conventional &quot;hole&quot; current is in the negative direction of the electron current and the negative of the electrical charge which gives &lt;math&gt;I_x=ntw(-v_x)(-e)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[charge carrier density]], &lt;math&gt;tw&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area, and &lt;math&gt;-e&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of each electron.  Solving for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and plugging into the above gives the Hall voltage:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{H} = \frac{I_x B_z}{n t e}&lt;/math&gt;

If the charge build up had been positive (as it appears in some semiconductors), then the &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt; assigned in the image would have been negative (positive charge would have built up on the left side).

The Hall coefficient is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{H} =\frac{E_y}{j_x B_z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[current density]] of the carrier electrons, and &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; is the induced electric field. In SI units, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{H} =\frac{E_y}{j_x B}= \frac{V_\mathrm{H} t}{IB}=-\frac{1}{ne}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The units of &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt; are usually expressed as m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/C, or Ω·cm/[[Gauss (unit)|G]], or other variants.) As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field.

One very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the opposite. The Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. The Hall effect also showed that in some substances (especially [[p-type semiconductor]]s), it is more appropriate to think of the current as positive &quot;[[Electron hole|holes]]&quot; moving rather than negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall effect is that holes moving to the left are really electrons moving to the right, so one expects the same sign of the Hall coefficient for both electrons and holes. This confusion, however, can only be resolved by modern quantum mechanical theory of transport in solids.&lt;ref&gt;N.W. Ashcroft and N.D. Mermin &quot;Solid State Physics&quot; {{ISBN|978-0-03-083993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample inhomogeneity might result in spurious sign of the Hall effect, even in ideal [[Van der Pauw method|van der Pauw]] configuration of electrodes. For example, positive Hall effect was observed in evidently n-type semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ohgaki et al. &quot;Positive Hall coefficients obtained from contact misplacement on evident n-type ZnO films and crystals&quot; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1557/JMR.2008.0300 J. Mat. Res. 23(9) (2008) 2293]&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of artifact, in uniform materials, occurs when the sample's aspect ratio is not long enough: the full Hall voltage only develops far away from the current-introducing contacts, since at the contacts the transverse voltage is shorted out to zero.

===Hall effect in semiconductors===
When a current-carrying [[semiconductor]] is kept in a magnetic field, the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges.

The simple formula for the Hall coefficient given above becomes more complex in semiconductors where the carriers are generally both [[electrons]] and [[Electron hole|holes]] which may be present in different concentrations and have different [[Electron mobility|mobilities]]. For moderate magnetic fields the Hall coefficient is&lt;ref name='Kasap2001'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mems.caltech.edu/courses/EE40%20Web%20Files/Supplements/02_Hall_Effect_Derivation.pdf |title=Hall Effect in Semiconductors |accessdate= |last=Kasap |first=Safa |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5c0UeBBsZ |archivedate=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- O.V.

For large applied fields the simpler expression analogous to that for a single carrier type holds.

===Relationship with star formation===

===Quantum Hall effect===
{{Main|Quantum Hall effect}}
For a two-dimensional electron system which can be produced in a [[MOSFET]], in the presence of large [[magnetic field]] strength and low [[temperature]], one can observe the quantum Hall effect, in which the Hall [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] σ undergoes [[quantum Hall transitions]] to take on the quantized values.

===Spin Hall effect===
{{Main|Spin Hall effect}}
The spin Hall effect consists in the spin accumulation on the lateral boundaries of a current-carrying sample. No magnetic field is needed. It was predicted by [[M. I. Dyakonov]] and [[V. I. Perel]] in 1971 and observed experimentally more than 30 years later, both in semiconductors and in metals, at cryogenic as well as at room temperatures.

===Quantum spin Hall effect===
{{Main|Quantum spin Hall effect}}
For [[mercury telluride]] two dimensional quantum wells with strong spin-orbit coupling, in zero magnetic field, at low temperature, the quantum spin Hall effect has been recently observed.

===Anomalous Hall effect===
In [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials (and [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] materials in a [[magnetic field]]), the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, known as the '''anomalous Hall effect''' (or the '''extraordinary Hall effect'''), which depends directly on the [[magnetization]] of the material, and is often much larger than the ordinary Hall effect. (Note that this effect is ''not'' due to the contribution of the [[magnetization]] to the total [[magnetic field]].) For example, in nickel, the anomalous Hall coefficient is about 100 times larger than the ordinary Hall coefficient near the Curie temperature, but the two are similar at very low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=95 |pages=1154–1160 |year=1954 |author=Robert Karplus and J. M. Luttinger |title=Hall Effect in Ferromagnetics |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.1154| issue=5|bibcode = 1954PhRv...95.1154K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a well-recognized phenomenon, there is still debate about its origins in the various materials. The anomalous Hall effect can be either an ''extrinsic'' (disorder-related) effect due to [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent [[scattering]] of the [[charge carrier]]s, or an ''intrinsic'' effect which can be described in terms of the [[geometric phase|Berry phase]] effect in the crystal momentum space (''k''-space).&lt;ref name=&quot;sinitsyn-08jpa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Semiclassical Theories of the Anomalous Hall Effect|author=N.

Sinitsyn 2008 J. Phys.: Condens. Mater. '''20''' 023201 --&gt;

=== Hall effect in ionized gases ===
The Hall effect in an ionized gas ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) is significantly different from the Hall effect in solids (where the '''Hall parameter''' is always much less than unity). In a plasma, the Hall parameter can take any value. The Hall parameter, ''β'', in a plasma is the ratio between the electron [[Gyroradius|gyrofrequency]], Ω''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the electron-heavy particle collision frequency, ''ν'':

:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac {\Omega_\mathrm{e}}{\nu}=\frac {eB}{m_\mathrm{e}\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]] (approx. 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;C)
* &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]])
* &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron|electron mass]] (approx. 9.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg).

The Hall parameter value increases with the magnetic field strength.

Physically, the trajectories of electrons are curved by the [[Lorentz force]]. Nevertheless, when the Hall parameter is low, their motion between two encounters with heavy particles ([[Neutral particle|neutral]] or [[ion]]) is almost linear. But if the Hall parameter is high, the electron movements are highly curved. The [[current density]] vector, ''J'', is no longer colinear with the [[electric field]] vector, ''E''. The two vectors ''J'' and ''E'' make the '''Hall angle''', ''θ'', which also gives the Hall parameter:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \tan(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
[[Hall probe]]s are often used as [[magnetometer]]s, i.e. to measure magnetic fields, or inspect materials (such as tubing or pipelines) using the principles of [[magnetic flux leakage]].

Hall effect devices produce a very low signal level and thus require amplification. While suitable for laboratory instruments, the [[vacuum tube]] [[amplifier]]s available in the first half of the 20th century were too expensive, power consuming, and unreliable for everyday applications. It was only with the development of the low cost [[integrated circuit]] that the Hall effect sensor became suitable for mass application. Many devices now sold as [[Hall effect sensor]]s in fact contain both the sensor as described above plus a high gain [[integrated circuit]] (IC) amplifier in a single package. Recent advances have further added into one package an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[I²C]] (Inter-integrated circuit communication protocol) IC for direct connection to a [[microcontroller]]'s I/O port.

===Advantages over other methods===
Hall effect devices (when appropriately packaged) are immune to dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.

Zero current output voltage is midway between the supply voltages that maintain a 4 to 8 volt differential. Non-zero current response is proportional to the voltage supplied and is linear to 60 amperes for this particular (25&amp;nbsp;A) device.]]
When electrons flow through a conductor, a magnetic field is produced. Thus, it is possible to create a non-contacting current sensor. The device has three terminals.
A sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several advantages; no additional resistance (a [[Shunt (electrical)|''shunt'']], required for the most common current sensing method) need be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor, which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.

===Disadvantages compared with other methods===
Magnetic flux from the surroundings (such as other wires) may diminish or enhance the field the Hall probe intends to detect, rendering the results inaccurate. Also, as Hall voltage is often on the order of millivolts, the output from this type of sensor cannot be used to directly drive actuators but instead must be amplified by a [[transistor]]-based circuit.

Ways to measure component positions within an electromagnetic system, such as a brushless direct current motor, include (1) the Hall effect, (2) light detection with a light-dark position encoder such as a [[Gray code]] disk and (3) induced voltage by moving the amount of metal core inserted into a transformer. When Hall is compared to photo-sensitive methods, it is harder to get absolute position with Hall. Hall detection is also sensitive to stray magnetic fields.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Contemporary applications===
Hall effect sensors are readily available from a number of different manufacturers, and may be used in various sensors such as rotating speed sensors (bicycle wheels, gear-teeth, automotive speedometers, electronic ignition systems), fluid [[flow sensor]]s, [[current sensor]]s, and [[pressure sensor]]s. Common applications are often found where a robust and contactless switch or potentiometer is required. These include: electric [[airsoft]] guns, triggers of electropneumatic [[paintball marker|paintball guns]], go-cart speed controls, smart phones, and some global positioning systems.

====Ferrite toroid Hall effect current transducer====
[[Image:RAZC-GENARRv1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram of Hall effect current transducer integrated into ferrite ring.]]

Hall sensors can detect stray magnetic fields easily, including that of Earth, so they work well as electronic compasses: but this also means that such stray fields can hinder accurate measurements of small magnetic fields. To solve this problem, Hall sensors are often integrated with magnetic shielding of some kind. For example, a Hall sensor integrated into a ferrite ring (as shown) can reduce the detection of stray fields by a factor of 100 or better (as the external magnetic fields cancel across the ring, giving no residual [[magnetic flux]]). This configuration also provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and drift effects of over 20 times that of a bare Hall device.
The range of a given feedthrough sensor may be extended upward and downward by appropriate wiring. To extend the range to lower currents, multiple turns of the current-carrying wire may be made through the opening, each turn adding to the sensor output the same quantity; when the sensor is installed onto a printed circuit board, the turns can be carried out by a staple on the board. To extend the range to higher currents, a current divider may be used. The divider splits the current across two wires of differing widths and the thinner wire, carrying a smaller proportion of the total current, passes through the sensor.

[[Image:Ampere-Turnsv1.jpg|thumb|250px|Multiple 'turns' and corresponding transfer function.]]

====Split ring clamp-on sensor====
A variation on the ring sensor uses a [[Current clamp#Hall effect|split sensor]] which is clamped onto the line enabling the device to be used in temporary test equipment. If used in a permanent installation, a split sensor allows the electric current to be tested without dismantling the existing circuit.

====Analog multiplication====
The output is proportional to both the applied magnetic field and the applied sensor voltage.  If the magnetic field is applied by a solenoid, the sensor output is proportional to the product of the current through the solenoid and the sensor voltage. As most applications requiring computation are now performed by small [[computer|digital computers]], the remaining useful application is in power sensing, which combines current sensing with voltage sensing in a single Hall effect device.

====Power measurement====
By sensing the current provided to a load and using the device's applied voltage as a sensor voltage it is possible to determine the power dissipated by a device.

====Position and motion sensing====
Hall effect devices used in motion sensing and motion limit switches can offer enhanced reliability in extreme environments. As there are no moving parts involved within the sensor or magnet, typical life expectancy is improved compared to traditional electromechanical switches. Additionally, the sensor and magnet may be encapsulated in an appropriate protective material. This application is used in [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motors]].

====Automotive ignition and fuel injection====
Commonly used in distributors for ignition timing (and in some types of crank and camshaft position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor is used as a direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing though the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an [[open collector]] and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.

====Wheel rotation sensing====
The sensing of wheel rotation is especially useful in [[anti-lock braking system]]s. The principles of such systems have been extended and refined to offer more than anti-skid functions, now providing extended vehicle [[automobile handling|handling]] enhancements.

====Electric motor control====
Some types of [[brushless DC electric motor]]s use Hall effect sensors to detect the position of the rotor and feed that information to the motor controller. This allows for more precise motor control

====Industrial applications====
Applications for Hall effect sensing have also expanded to industrial applications, which now use Hall effect [[Joystick#Industrial applications|joysticks]] to control hydraulic valves, replacing the traditional mechanical levers with contactless sensing. Such applications include mining trucks, backhoe loaders, cranes, diggers, scissor lifts, etc.

====Spacecraft propulsion====
A [[Hall-effect thruster]] (HET) is a relatively low power device that is used to propel some [[spacecraft]], after it gets into [[orbit]] or farther out into space. In the HET, [[atom]]s are [[ionization|ionized]] and accelerated by an [[electric field]]. A radial magnetic field established by magnets on the thruster is used to trap [[electron]]s which then orbit and create an [[electric field]] due to the Hall effect. A large potential is established between the end of the thruster where neutral propellant is fed, and the part where electrons are produced; so, electrons trapped in the magnetic field cannot drop to the lower potential.  They are thus extremely energetic, which means that they can ionize neutral atoms. Neutral propellant is pumped into the chamber and is ionized by the trapped electrons.  Positive ions and electrons are then ejected from the thruster as a quasineutral [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], creating thrust.

==The Corbino effect==
[[File:Corbino disc by Zureks.svg|thumb|Corbino disc – dashed curves represent [[logarithmic spiral]] paths of deflected electrons]]

The [[Orso Mario Corbino|Corbino]] effect is a phenomenon involving the Hall effect, but a disc-shaped metal sample is used in place of a rectangular one. Because of its shape the Corbino disc allows the observation of Hall effect–based [[magnetoresistance]] without the associated Hall voltage.

A radial current through a circular disc, subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the disc, produces a &quot;circular&quot; current through the disc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams1915&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hall and Corbino effects|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|year=1915|first=E. P.|last=Adams|volume=54|issue=216|pages=47–51|id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA47|format=|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-1-4223-7256-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of the free transverse boundaries renders the interpretation of the Corbino effect simpler than that of the Hall effect.

'''Hoover Dam''' is a [[concrete]] [[arch-gravity dam]] in the [[Black Canyon of the Colorado|Black Canyon]] of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], on the border between the U.S. states of [[Nevada]] and [[Arizona]]. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the [[Great Depression]] and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Originally known as '''Boulder Dam''' from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The [[dam]] was named after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]].

Since about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby [[Boulder Canyon (Colorado River)|Boulder Canyon]] had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce [[hydroelectric power]]. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called [[Six Companies, Inc.]], which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.

Hoover Dam impounds [[Lake Mead]], the largest reservoir in the United States by volume (when it is full).&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/tsc/eco_research/eco5.html |title=Reservoir Monitoring &amp; Research |work=usbr.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906043817/http://www.usbr.gov/tsc/eco_research/eco5.html |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }} (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt; The dam is located near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about {{convert|abbr=on|30|mi}} southeast of [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. The dam's generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction; nearly a million people tour the dam each year. The heavily traveled [[U.S. Route 93]] (US&amp;nbsp;93) ran along the dam's crest until October 2010, when the [[Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge|Hoover Dam Bypass]] opened.

== Background ==

=== Search for resources ===
As the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the [[Alamo Canal]] just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the [[Imperial Valley]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=20–27}} Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the [[Salton Sea]],{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=41–50}} the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] spent $3&amp;nbsp;million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=57–60}}

[[File:Hoover-dam-site.jpg|thumb|left|River view of the future site of Hoover Dam, circa 1904]]
As the technology of [[electric power transmission]] improved, the [[Lower Colorado River Valley|Lower Colorado]] was considered for its [[hydroelectric]]-power potential. In 1902, the [[Southern California Edison|Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles]] surveyed the river in the hope of building a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} rock dam which could generate {{convert|10,000|hp}}. However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was {{convert|80|mi}}, and there were few customers (mostly mines) within that limit. Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse—including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=55–56}}

In the following years, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] (BOR), known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief [[Arthur Powell Davis]] proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=58–59}} {{convert|20|mi}} north of the eventual dam site, into the river.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=2}} The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=58–59}}

=== Planning and agreements ===
[[File:Boulder damsite sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of proposed Boulder Canyon dam site and reservoir, circa 1921]]
In 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary [[Albert Fall]]. The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern, because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=67}} Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam &quot;at or near Boulder Canyon&quot;, the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=68}} One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a [[geologic fault]]; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=68}} or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=6}} Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the &quot;Boulder Canyon Project&quot;.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=26–27}}

With little guidance on water allocation from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], proponents of the dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an [[interstate compact]], with the approval of Congress. Such compacts were authorized by [[Article I of the United States Constitution]] but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-[[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=73–79}} Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the ''[[Wyoming v. Colorado]]'' decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting [[Colorado River Compact]] was signed on November 24, 1922.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=81–87}}

Legislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by two California Republicans, Representative [[Phil Swing]] and Senator [[Hiram Johnson]], but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The [[1927 Mississippi flood]] made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the [[St. Francis Dam]], constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved-gravity type,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Rogers
| first = J. David |url= http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/st_francis_dam/index.htm |title= Impacts of the 1928 St. Francis Dam Failure on Geology, Civil Engineering, and America |journal= 2007 Annual Meeting Association of Environmental and Engineering Geologists |publisher= Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar in design to the arch-gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea. The Board cautioned: &quot;To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2010}}

On December 21, 1928 [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]] signed the bill authorizing the dam.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=118}} The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $165&amp;nbsp;million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream [[Imperial Dam]] and [[All-American Canal]], a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=27}} It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=120}}

=== Design, preparation and contracting ===
[[File:Hoover-dam-contour-map.jpg|left|thumb|Hoover Dam architectural plans]]
Even before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete [[arch-gravity dam]], the design of which was overseen by the Bureau's chief design engineer [[John L. Savage]]. The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top, and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam. The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water's force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon. The wedge-shaped dam would be {{convert|abbr=on|660|ft}} thick at the bottom, narrowing to {{convert|abbr=on|45|ft}} at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=27–28}}

On January 10, 1931, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy. The government was to provide the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100&amp;nbsp;pages of text and 76&amp;nbsp;drawings. A $2&amp;nbsp;million [[bid bond]] was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5&amp;nbsp;million [[performance bond]]. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=34}}

The [[Wattis Brothers]], heads of the [[Utah Construction Company]], were interested in bidding on the project, but lacked the money for the performance bond. They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, [[Morrison-Knudsen]], which employed the nation's leading dam builder, [[Frank Crowe]]. They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Henry J. Kaiser]] &amp; W. A. [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel Company]] of San Francisco; MacDonald &amp; Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=35–42}} The joint venture was called [[Six Companies, Inc.]] as Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of 6 in the name. The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the San Franciscans in the bid, where &quot;Six Companies&quot; was also a [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association|Chinese benevolent association in the city]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=174}} There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=45–46}}

The city of Las Vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction, closing its many [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior [[Ray Wilbur]] came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site. This town became known as [[Boulder City, Nevada]]. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=144–145}}

== Construction ==

=== Labor force ===
[[File:HooverDamJumboRig.jpg|thumb|Workers on a &quot;Jumbo Rig&quot;; used for drilling Hoover Dam's tunnels]]
[[File:&quot;Apache Indians employed as high-scalers on the construction of Hoover Dam.&quot; - NARA - 293746.tif|thumb|&quot;Apache Indians employed as high-scalers on the construction of Hoover Dam.&quot; – NARA]]
Soon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed people converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=28}} A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=32}} Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as &quot;Ragtown&quot;.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=53–54}} When construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=194}} and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=317}} &quot;Mongolian&quot; (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=317}} while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=315}}

As part of the contract, Six Companies, Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers. The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began, but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=65}} The company built bunkhouses, attached to the canyon wall, to house 480&amp;nbsp;single men at what became known as River Camp. Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed,{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=56}} and many lived in Ragtown.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=40}} The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather, and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid, with the daytime high averaging {{convert|abbr=on|119.9|°F |°C}}.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=219–220}} Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of [[heat prostration]] between June 25 and July 26, 1931.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=223}}

[[File:FrankCrowe.jpg|thumb|left|General Superintendent [[Frank Crowe]] (right) with Bureau of Reclamation engineer Walker Young in 1935]]
The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW or &quot;Wobblies&quot;), though much-reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century, hoped to unionize the Six Companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent. They sent eleven organizers,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=226–228}} several of whom were arrested by Las Vegas police.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=230}} On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent away the organizers, not wanting to be associated with the &quot;Wobblies&quot;, they formed a committee to represent them with the company. The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning. He was noncommittal. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic; instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as &quot;malcontents&quot;.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=234–237}}

On the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=70–73}} Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=73–78}} While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=78}}

A second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=362–365}}

=== River diversion ===
[[File:Hoover-summary-map.jpg|thumb|Overview of dam mechanisms; diversion tunnels shown]]
Before the dam could be built, the [[Colorado River]] needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the [[Nevada]] side and two on the [[Arizona]] side. These tunnels were {{convert|abbr=on|56|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbrfaq&quot; /&gt; Their combined length was nearly 16,000&amp;nbsp;ft, or more than {{convert|3|mi|km|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovtun&quot; /&gt; The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $3,000-per-day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}}

Tunneling began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or invert, was poured. [[Gantry crane]]s, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The sidewalls were poured next. Movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls. Finally, using pneumatic guns, the overheads were filled in. The concrete lining is {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to {{convert|abbr=on|50|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovtun&quot; /&gt; The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels on November 13, 1932; the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water. This was done by exploding a temporary [[cofferdam]] protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=305–306}}

Following the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovtun&quot; /&gt; The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbrfaq&quot; /&gt; The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbrfaq&quot; /&gt;

=== Groundworks, rock clearance and grout curtain ===
To protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Cofferdams&quot; /&gt; The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was {{convert|abbr=on|96|ft}} high, and {{convert|750|ft}} thick at its base, thicker than the dam itself. It contained {{convert|650,000|cuyd}} of material.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=318–319}}

[[File:HooverDamHighScaler.jpg|left|thumb|Looking down at &quot;high scalers&quot; above the Colorado River]]

When the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove [[Fluvial|accumulated erosion soils]] and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|1,500,000 |cuyd}} of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Cofferdams&quot; /&gt;

The men who removed this rock were called &quot;high scalers&quot;. While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with [[jackhammers]] and [[dynamite]]. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, High Scalers&quot; /&gt; One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the &quot;Human Pendulum&quot; for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=308–309}} To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called &quot;hard boiled hats&quot; (later &quot;[[hard hat]]s&quot;) and strongly encouraged their use.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=104}}

The cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a [[grout curtain]]. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as {{convert|150|ft}} into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit &quot;uplift&quot;—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=331–332}} After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=387–390}} It took nine years (1938–47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers 2005&quot; /&gt;

=== Concrete ===
[[File:Damforms.jpg|thumb|Columns of Hoover Dam being filled with concrete, February 1934 (looking upstream from the Nevada rim)]]
The first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18&amp;nbsp;months ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=323–324}} Since concrete [[Thermal expansion|heats and contracts]] as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as {{convert|abbr=on|50|ft|m |adj=mid|square}} and {{convert|5|ft}} high.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=325–326}} Each five-foot form contained a series of {{convert|1|in |adj=on}} steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a [[refrigeration]] plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with [[grout]]. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=193–194}}

The concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets {{convert|7|ft|m|disp=x| high (|)}} and almost 7&amp;nbsp;feet in diameter; Crowe was awarded two patents for their design. These buckets, which weighed {{convert|20|ST|t}} when full, were filled at two massive concrete plants on the Nevada side, and were delivered to the site in special [[Railroad car|railcars]]. The buckets were then suspended from aerial [[cableway]]s, which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column. As the required grade of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam (from pea-sized gravel to 9-inch or 23&amp;nbsp;cm stones), it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column. When the bottom of the bucket opened up, disgorging {{convert|abbr=on|8|cuyd}} of concrete, a team of men worked it throughout the form. Although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day, each bucket only deepened the concrete in a form by an inch, and Six Companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=327–330}}

A total of {{convert|3250000|cuyd}} of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935. In addition, {{convert|abbr=on|1,110,000|cuyd}} were used in the power plant and other works. More than {{convert|582|mi}} of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete. Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbrfaq&quot; /&gt; Concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in 1995; they showed that &quot;Hoover Dam's concrete has continued to slowly gain strength&quot; and the dam is composed of a &quot;durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete&quot;.{{sfn|Bartojay|Joy|2010}} Hoover Dam concrete is not subject to [[alkali–silica reaction]] (ASR) as the Hoover Dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate, unlike that at downstream [[Parker Dam]], where ASR has caused measurable deterioration.{{sfn|Bartojay|Joy|2010}}

=== Dedication and completion ===
[[File:Damupstream.jpg|thumb|left|The upstream face of Hoover Dam slowly disappears as Lake Mead fills, May 1935 (looking downstream from the Arizona rim)]]
With most work finished on the dam itself (the powerhouse remained uncompleted), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. Pacific time to 11&amp;nbsp;a.m.; this was done because [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Harold L. Ickes]] had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=366–369}} Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of {{convert|abbr=on|102|°F|°C}}, 10,000&amp;nbsp;people were present for the President's speech, in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=373}} who was not invited to the ceremony.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=304}} To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the [[United States Post Office Department]]—bearing the name &quot;Boulder Dam&quot;, the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}} After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=373}}

Most work had been completed by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935, and early 1936, to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government. The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=250–252}}

=== Construction deaths ===
[[File:HansenHooverMemorial.jpg|thumb|[[Oskar J. W. Hansen]]'s memorial at the dam which reads in part &quot;They died to make the desert bloom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt;]]

There were 112&amp;nbsp;deaths associated with the construction of the dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;blf1&quot; /&gt; The first was J. G. Tierney, a surveyor who drowned on December 20, 1922, while looking for an ideal spot for the dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;blf1&quot; /&gt; The last death on the project's official fatality list occurred on December 20, 1935, when an &quot;electrician's helper&quot;, Patrick Tierney, the son of J. G. Tierney, fell from an intake tower. Included in the fatality list are three workers, one in 1932 and two in 1933, who committed suicide onsite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = DuTemple| first = Lesley| year = 2003| title = The Hoover Dam| publisher = Twenty-First Century Books| page = 82 | isbn = 0822546914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | date = | title = Fatalities at Hoover Dam| work = Desert Gazette | url = http://digital-desert.com/hoover-dam/fatalities.html | accessdate = 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first =  | date = 12 March 2015| title = Hoover Dam: 1935 Fatalities| work = United States Bureau of Reclamation| url = http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fat1935.html| accessdate = 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-six of the deaths occurred during construction at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;blf1&quot; /&gt; Of the 112&amp;nbsp;fatalities, 91 were Six Companies employees, three were BOR employees, and one was a visitor to the site, with the remainder employees of various contractors not part of Six Companies.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=320}}

Not included in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as [[pneumonia]]. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning (brought on by the use of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=284–286}} The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached {{convert|abbr=on|140|F|C}}, enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases.&lt;ref name=&quot;I&amp;amp;T-2010.V25.2&quot; /&gt; A total of 42&amp;nbsp;workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=284–286}}

=== Architectural style ===
[[File:HansenBasReliefHooverDam.jpg|thumb|upright|Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator]]
The initial plans for the facade of the dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and ornaments clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-inspired [[baluster|balustrade]] and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect [[Gordon Kaufmann|Gordon B. Kaufmann]], then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=341}} Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant [[Art Deco]] style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona&amp;nbsp;— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe [[Daylight Saving Time]], the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhinehart 2004&quot; /&gt;

At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist [[Allen Tupper True]]{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=341}} was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Pueblo]] tribes of the region.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=342–343}} Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=346}} With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=343}} The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals&amp;nbsp;— lizards, serpents, birds&amp;nbsp;— and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=342–343}} In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=358}}

[[File:HooverDamTrueDesign.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tile floor designed by Allen Tupper True]]
With the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised an innovative color-coding for the pipes and machinery, which was implemented throughout all BOR projects.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=354–356}} True's consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the [[Parker Dam|Parker]], [[Shasta Dam|Shasta]] and [[Grand Coulee Dam|Grand Coulee]] dams and power plants. True's work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', part of which read, &quot;lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme&quot;.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=361–362}}

Complementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, naturalized American sculptor [[Oskar J.W. Hansen]] designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the [[Relief|bas-reliefs]] on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express &quot;the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment&quot;, because &quot;[t]he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt; Hansen's dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole.
[[File:Hoover Dam star map floor center.jpg|thumb|Hoover Dam memorial star map floor, center area]]
Surrounding the base of the monument is a [[terrazzo]] floor embedded with a &quot;star map&quot;. The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt's dedication of the dam. This is intended to help future astronomers, if necessary, calculate the exact date of dedication.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=379–380}} The {{convert|30|ft |m|adj=mid|-high}} bronze figures, dubbed &quot;Winged Figures of the Republic&quot;, were each formed in a continuous pour. To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface, they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|p=43}} Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam: flood control, navigation, irrigation, water storage, and power. The bas-relief on the Arizona elevator depicts, in his words, &quot;the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt;

== Operation ==
=== Power plant and water demands ===&lt;!-- Section is linked --&gt;
[[File:HooverDamFrontWater.jpg|thumb|Hoover Dam releasing water from the jet-flow gates in 1998]]
Excavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before the last of the concrete was poured that May.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Chronology&quot; /&gt; The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500&amp;nbsp;men remained to finish it and other structures.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=248}} To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about {{convert|3.5|ft}}, topped with layers of sand and tar.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|pp=280–281}}

In the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three [[Allis Chalmers]] built [[Francis turbine]]-[[electric generator|generators]], all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Chronology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A2Z Las Vegas, Hoover&quot; /&gt; Original plans called for 16&amp;nbsp;large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt; The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Dam and Powerplant&quot; /&gt;

Before water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing [[penstock]]s which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum [[hydraulic head]] (water pressure) of {{convert|abbr=on|590|ft|m}} as the water reaches a speed of about {{convert|abbr=on|85|mph |km/h|-1}}. The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and [[outlet works]] (jet-flow gates) are rarely used.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt; The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures {{convert|180|ft}} above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|p=40}} Following an [[Grid energy storage#Hydroelectric dam uprating|uprating]] project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] [[Pelton turbine]]-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt; The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 [[terawatt-hour|TWh]] in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt; The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947–2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt; In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.&lt;ref name=&quot;BoRCRSRDec15&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/2015/DEC15.pdf | title=OPERATION PLAN FOR COLORADO RIVER SYSTEM RESERVOIRS| publisher=Bureau of Reclamation|date=December 2015|accessdate = 7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of electricity generated by Hoover Dam has been decreasing along with the [[Lake Mead#Drought and water usage issues|falling water level in Lake Mead]] due to the prolonged drought in the 2010s and high demand for the Colorado River's water. Lake Mead fell to a new record low elevation of {{convert|1,071.61|ft|m}} on July 1, 2016 before beginning to rebound slowly.&lt;ref&gt;http://knau.org/post/lake-mead-drops-its-lowest-ever-level&lt;/ref&gt; Under its original design, the dam will no longer be able to generate power once the water level falls below {{convert|1,050|ft|m}}, which could occur as early as 2017. To lower the minimum power pool elevation from {{convert|1,050|to |950|ft}}, five wide-head turbines, designed to work efficiently with less flow, are being installed and will be fully online by 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRRC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wrrc.arizona.edu/drought-diminishes-hydropower | title=Drought Diminishes Hydropower Capacity in Western U.S. |publisher= Water Resources Research Center |date=Winter 2015 |accessdate= May 24, 2015 |last= Capehart |first=Mary Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the low water levels, by 2014 it was providing power only during periods of peak demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Receding}&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060002129 | title =Receding Lake Mead poses challenges to Hoover Dam's power output | publisher = E&amp;E Publishing, LLC | date=June 30, 2014 | accessdate= June 7, 2016| last=Kuckro| first=Rod }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Dam and Powerplant&quot; /&gt;

Lake Mead and downstream releases from the dam also provide water for both [[Water supply|municipal]] and [[irrigation]] uses. Water released from the Hoover Dam eventually reaches several canals. The [[Colorado River Aqueduct]] and [[Central Arizona Project]] branch off [[Lake Havasu]] while the [[All-American Canal]] is supplied by the [[Imperial Dam]]. In total, water from the Lake Mead serves 18 million people in Arizona, Nevada and California and supplies the irrigation of over {{convert|abbr=on|1,000,000|acre}} of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Dam and Powerplant&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Parker Dam and Powerplant |url= http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/brochures/parker.html |publisher= U.S. Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate= 16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power distribution ====
Electricity from the dam's powerhouse was originally sold pursuant to a fifty-year contract, authorized by Congress in 1934, which ran from 1937 to 1987. In 1984, Congress passed a new statute which set power allocations from the dam from 1987 to 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lien-Mager 2011&quot; /&gt; The powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison; in 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation assumed control.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|pp=50–52}} In 2011, Congress enacted legislation extending the current contracts until 2067, after setting aside 5% of Hoover Dam's power for sale to Native American tribes, electric cooperatives, and other entities. The new arrangement began on October 1, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lien-Mager 2011&quot; /&gt; 

The [[Bureau of Reclamation]] reports that the energy generated under the contracts ending in 2017 was allocated as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt;

=== Spillways ===
[[File:Hoover Dam and Arizona Spillway, 1983.jpg|thumb|Water enters the Arizona spillway (left) during the 1983 floods. Lake Mead water level was {{convert|abbr=on|1,225.6|ft}}]]
The dam is protected against over-topping by two [[spillway]]s. The spillway entrances are located behind each dam [[Abutment#Miscellanea|abutment]], running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow [[weir]] with each spillway containing four {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} steel-drum gates. Each gate weighs {{convert|5,000,000|lb}} and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates could not entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but could maintain an extra {{convert|abbr=on|16|ft}} of lake level.&lt;ref name=&quot;recspi&quot; /&gt;
Water flowing over the spillways falls dramatically into {{convert|600|ft|m |adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|50|ft|m |adj=mid|-wide}} spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels, and reentering the main river channel below the dam. This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate {{convert|700|ft|adj=on}} elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges. Each spillway's capacity of {{convert|abbr=on|200,000|ft3/s |m3/s}} was empirically verified in post-construction tests in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;recspi&quot; /&gt;

The large spillway tunnels have only been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock.{{sfn|Fiedler|2010}} The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused [[cavitation]], a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror-smooth.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=391–392}} The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways.{{sfn|Fiedler|2010}} Tests at [[Grand Coulee Dam]] showed that the technique worked, in principle.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=391–392}}

=== Roadway and tourism ===
{{See also|Hoover Dam in popular culture}}
[[File:Hoover Dam, Colorado River.JPG|thumb|The bypass in front of the dam]]
There are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for [[U.S. Route 93]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/20101017hoover-dam-bypass-bridge-opening.html|title=Hoover Damn Bypass an American Triumph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], authorities expressed security concerns and the [[Hoover Dam Bypass]] project was expedited. Pending the completion of the bypass, restricted traffic was permitted over Hoover Dam. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while [[semi-trailer truck]]s, [[bus]]es carrying luggage, and enclosed-[[box truck]]s over {{convert|abbr=on|40|ft|m}} long were not allowed on the dam at all, and were diverted to [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] or Nevada State Routes [[Nevada State Route 163|163]]/[[Nevada State Route 68|68]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Crossing Hoover&quot; /&gt; The four-lane Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 19, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen 2010-10-20&quot; /&gt; It includes a composite steel and concrete [[arch bridge]], the [[Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge]], {{convert|abbr=on|1,500|ft}} downstream from the dam.
With the opening of the bypass, through traffic is no longer allowed across Hoover Dam; dam visitors are allowed to use the existing roadway to approach from the Nevada side and cross to parking lots and other facilities on the Arizona side.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdbfaq&quot; /&gt;

Hoover Dam opened for tours in 1937 after its completion, but following [[Imperial Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, it was closed to the public when the United States entered World War II, during which only authorized traffic, in convoys, was permitted. After the war, it reopened September 2, 1945, and by 1953, annual attendance had risen to 448,081. The dam closed on November 25, 1963 and March 31, 1969, days of mourning in remembrance of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]. In 1995, a new visitors' center was built, and the following year, visits exceeded one million for the first time. The dam closed again to the public on September 11, 2001; modified tours were resumed in December and a new &quot;Discovery Tour&quot; was added the following year.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|pp=50–52}} Today, nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the Bureau of Reclamation.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Tour&quot; /&gt; Increased security concerns by the government have led to most of the interior structure being inaccessible to tourists. As a result, few of True's decorations can now be seen by visitors.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=379}}

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:Hoover Dam 08sept09 showing water elevation of Lake Mead.jpg|thumb|View upstream from Hoover Dam, Sept. 2009. Water elevation on this date was 1093.77 ft.]]

The changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam's construction and operation have had a large impact on the [[Colorado River Delta]].{{sfn|Glenn Lee et al.|1996}} The construction of the dam has been implicated in causing the decline of this [[estuarine]] [[ecosystem]].{{sfn|Glenn Lee et al.|1996}} For six years after the construction of the dam, while Lake Mead filled, virtually no water reached the mouth of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2001&quot; /&gt; The delta's estuary, which once had a freshwater-saltwater mixing zone stretching {{convert|40|mi}} south of the river's mouth, was turned into an [[inverse estuary]] where the level of [[salinity]] was higher close to the river's mouth.{{sfn|Rodriguez Flessa et al.|2001}}

The Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals.{{sfn|Schmidt Webb et al.|1998}} The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam.{{sfn|Cohn|2001}} Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the [[Bonytail chub]], [[Colorado pikeminnow]], [[Humpback chub]], and [[Razorback sucker]], are listed as [[endangered species|endangered]].{{sfn|Minckley Marsh et al.|2003}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FWS, Colorado River Recovery&quot; /&gt;

== Naming controversy ==
[[File:Los Angeles Times, It can't be done Mr. Ickes, Hoover Dam.jpg|thumb|Los Angeles Times political cartoon commenting on the attempts of Ickes to keep 'Hoover' off of the dam.]]
During the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the press generally referred to the dam as &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; or as &quot;Boulder Canyon Dam&quot;, even though the proposed site had shifted to Black Canyon.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=26–27}} The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (BCPA) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam. The BCPA merely allows the government to &quot;construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Boulder Canyon Project Act&quot; /&gt;

When Secretary [[Ray Wilbur|Wilbur]] spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam &quot;Hoover Dam&quot;, citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was &quot;the great engineer whose vision and persistence&amp;nbsp;... has done so much to make &lt;nowiki&gt;[the dam]&lt;/nowiki&gt; possible&quot;.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=305}} One writer complained in response that &quot;the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the country.&quot;{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=305}}

After Hoover's election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the Roosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933, that the dam be referred to as &quot;Boulder Dam&quot;. Ickes stated that Wilbur had been imprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=305}} Unknown to the general public, Attorney General [[Homer Cummings]] informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name &quot;Hoover Dam&quot; in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam.{{sfn|Cummings|1939|p=254}} The official status this conferred to the name &quot;Hoover Dam&quot; had been noted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman [[Edward T. Taylor]] of Colorado on December 12, 1930,&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Record'', Vol. 74 part 1, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt; but was likewise ignored by Ickes.

When Ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his diary, &quot;to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam.&quot;{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}} At one point in the speech, he spoke the words &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; five times within thirty seconds.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=246}} Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator [[Hiram Johnson]], a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}} Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam,{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=248}} and the Republican-leaning ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', which at the time of Ickes' name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign &quot;HOOVER DAM,&quot; reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=374}}

In the following years, the name &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed. Memories of the [[Great Depression]] faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name &quot;Hoover Dam.&quot; Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, &quot;I didn't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.&quot;{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=381}}

==Recognition==
Hoover Dam was recognized as a [[National Civil Engineering Landmark]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;RogersEtAl&quot;/&gt;  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981, and was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985, cited for its engineering innovations.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhlsum&quot;/&gt;

'''''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''''' (or, in more recent editions, '''''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''''') is a novel by [[Mark Twain]], first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the [[Great American Novel]]s, the work is among the first in major [[American literature]] to be written throughout in [[vernacular]] English, characterized by [[American literary regionalism|local color regionalism]]. It is told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] by [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn]], a friend of [[Tom Sawyer]], the narrator of two other Twain novels (''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]''). It is a direct sequel to ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''.

The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the [[Mississippi River]]. Set in a [[southern United States|Southern]] [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] society that had ceased to exist about 20 years before the work was published, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' is an often scathing [[satire]] on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.

Perennially popular with readers, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3cz3334b|title=Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's comrade).... ... - Full View – HathiTrust Digital Library – HathiTrust Digital Library|author=Twain, Mark |work=HathiTrust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 Jacob O'Leary, &quot;Critical Annotation of &quot;Minstrel Shackles and Nineteenth Century 'Liberality' in Huckleberry Finn&quot; (Fredrick Woodard and Donnarae MacCann),&quot; Wiki Service, University of Iowa, last modified February 11, 2012, accessed April 12, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312113444/http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 |date=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur &quot;[[nigger]]&quot;.

{{main|List of Tom Sawyer characters}}

In order of appearance:
* '''[[Huckleberry Finn]]''' (&quot;Huck&quot; to his friends) is a boy about &quot;thirteen or fourteen or along there&quot; years old. (Chapter 17)  He has been brought up by his father, the town drunk, and has a difficult time fitting into society.
* '''Widow Douglas''' is the kind woman who has taken Huck in after he helped save her from a violent home invasion. She tries her best to civilize Huck, believing it is her [[Christian]] duty.
* '''Miss Watson''' is the widow's sister, a tough old spinster who also lives with them. She is fairly hard on Huck, causing him to resent her a good deal. [[Mark Twain]] may have drawn inspiration for this character from several people he knew in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Hill&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Richard|title=Mark Twain Among The Scholars: Reconsidering Contemporary Twain Criticism|publisher=SJK Publishing Industries, Inc.|year=2002|pages=67–90|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=150a0acc-8b8f-4f78-80f4-a856a5a22df4%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=10&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLGN1c3R1aWQmY3VzdGlkPXM4NDU1ODYxJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=lkh&amp;AN=43261625|isbn=978-0-87875-527-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]''' is Miss Watson's physically large but mild-mannered slave. Huck becomes very close to Jim when they reunite after Jim flees Miss Watson's household to seek refuge from slavery, and Huck and Jim become fellow travelers on the Mississippi River.
* '''[[Tom Sawyer]]''' is Huck's best friend and peer, the main character of other Twain novels and the leader of the town boys in adventures. He is &quot;the best fighter and the smartest kid in town&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Hill&quot; /&gt;
* '''&quot;Pap&quot; Finn''', Huck's father, a brutal alcoholic drifter. He resents Huck getting any kind of education. His only genuine interest in his son involves begging or extorting money to feed his alcohol addiction.
* '''Judith Loftus''' plays a small part in the novel&amp;nbsp;— being the kind and perceptive woman whom Huck talks to in order to find out about the search for Jim&amp;nbsp;— but many critics believe her to be the best drawn female character in the novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Hill&quot; /&gt;
* '''The Grangerfords''', an aristocratic [[Kentuckian]] family headed by the [[sexagenarian]] '''Colonel Saul Grangerford''', take Huck in after he is separated from Jim on the Mississippi. Huck becomes close friends with the youngest male of the family, '''Buck Grangerford''', who is Huck's age. By the time Huck meets them, the Grangerfords have been engaged in an age-old [[blood feud]] with another local family, the Shepherdsons.
* '''The Duke''' and '''the King''' are two otherwise unnamed [[con artist]]s whom Huck and Jim take aboard their raft just before the start of their Arkansas adventures. They pose as the long-lost [[Duke of Bridgewater]] and the long-dead [[Louis XVII of France]] in an attempt to over-awe Huck and Jim, who quickly come to recognize them for what they are, but cynically pretend to accept their claims to avoid conflict.
* '''Doctor Robinson''' is the only man who recognizes that the King and Duke are phonies when they pretend to be British. He warns the town but they ignore him.
* '''Mary Jane, Joanna, and Susan Wilks''' are the three young nieces of their wealthy guardian, Peter Wilks, who has recently died. The duke and the king try to steal the inheritance left by Peter Wilks, by posing as Peter's estranged brothers from England.
* '''Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas Phelps''' buy Jim from the &quot;Duke&quot; and the &quot;King&quot;. She is a loving, high-strung &quot;farmer's wife&quot;, and he a plodding old man, both farmer and preacher. Huck poses as their nephew, after he parts from the con men.

== Plot summary ==
[[File:Huckleberry-finn-with-rabbit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Huckleberry Finn, as depicted by [[E. W. Kemble]] in the original 1884 edition of the book]]

=== In Missouri ===
The story begins in fictional St. Petersburg, Missouri (based on the actual town of [[Hannibal, Missouri]]), on the shore of the [[Mississippi River]] &quot;forty to fifty years ago&quot; (the novel having been published in 1884).  Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn (the [[protagonist]] and [[first-person narrator]]) and his friend, Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Sawyer, have each come into a considerable sum of money as a result of their earlier adventures (detailed in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''). Huck explains how he is placed under the [[guardianship]] of the Widow Douglas, who, together with her stringent sister, Miss Watson, are attempting to &quot;sivilize&quot; him and teach him religion. Finding civilized life confining, his spirits are raised somewhat when Tom Sawyer helps him to escape one night past Miss Watson's slave [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]], to meet up with Tom's gang of self-proclaimed &quot;robbers.&quot; Just as the gang's activities begin to bore Huck, he is suddenly interrupted by the reappearance of his shiftless father, &quot;Pap&quot;, an abusive [[alcoholic]]. Knowing that Pap would only spend the money on alcohol, Huck is successful in preventing Pap from acquiring his fortune; however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.

=== In Illinois and on Jackson's Island ===
Pap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the Illinois shoreline. Because of Pap's drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father's absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off downriver. He settles comfortably, on Jackson's Island. Here, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him &quot;down the river&quot; to presumably more brutal owners. Jim plans to make his way to the town of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] in Illinois, a free state, so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family's freedom. At first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck's close friend and guardian. After heavy flooding on the river, the two find a raft (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river. Entering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back. He prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.

To find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area. Huck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt. Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests. Once he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing. Huck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night. The two hastily load up the raft and depart.

After a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamship. Searching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed. They are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident. Jim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly. Huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.

=== In Kentucky: the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons ===
Traveling onward, Huck and Jim's raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two. Huck is given shelter on the Kentucky side of the river by the Grangerfords, an &quot;aristocratic&quot; family. He befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year [[blood feud]] against another family, the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love. The vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister elopes with a member of the Shepherdson clan. In the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses. He is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.

=== In Arkansas: the duke and the king ===
Near the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run [[Confidence trick|grifters]] aboard the raft. The younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English [[duke]] (the [[Duke of Bridgewater]]). The older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the [[Louis XVII of France#Lost Dauphin claimants|Lost Dauphin]], the son of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and rightful King of France. The &quot;duke&quot; and &quot;king&quot; soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey. To divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the &quot;Sick Arab&quot; so that he can move about the raft without bindings.

On one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called &quot;The Royal Nonesuch&quot;. The play turns out to be only a couple of minutes' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham. On the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done. By the third night of &quot;The Royal Nonesuch&quot;, the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.

In the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke pretends to be a [[deaf-mute]] while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—&quot;All right, then, I'll go to hell!&quot;—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.

=== On the Phelps' farm ===
Huck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Sally and Silas Phelps|Silas and Sally Phelps]]. The family's nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck's arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home. He plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising [[plot twist]], it is revealed that the expected nephew is, in fact, Tom Sawyer. When Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Sid Sawyer|Sid]], while Huck continues pretending to be Tom. In the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for &quot;The Royal Nonesuch&quot;, and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] and [[Riding a rail|ridden out of town on a rail]].

Rather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read,&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyno&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing Huck Finn: Mark Twain's creative process|author=Victor A.

During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Aunt Polly|Aunt Polly]] arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Mrs. Watson|Miss Watson]] died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father ([[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Pap Finn|Pap Finn]]) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to [[Indian Territory]].

== Major themes ==
''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' explores themes of race and identity. A complexity exists concerning Jim's character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted, moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word &quot;[[nigger]]&quot; and emphasizing the stereotypically &quot;comic&quot; treatment of Jim's lack of education, superstition and ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 2.

James S. Leonard, Thomas A. Tenney, and Thadious M. Davis (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives, and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts, he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and Jim's human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Mark Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that &quot;a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience&quot; and goes on to describe the novel as &quot;...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain (1895). ''Notebook No. 35''. Typescript, P. 35. Mark Twain Papers. Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

To highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes – which anyone would agree was the right thing to do – he then immediately encounters Jim &quot;illegally&quot; doing the same thing. The treatment both of them receive are radically different especially with an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/438790 Barbara Foley, &quot;Satire Or Evasion?

Nelson,&quot; ''Modern Philology'' 92.3 (1995): 379–85, JSTOR, accessed April 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars discuss Huck's own character, and the novel itself, in the context of its relation to African-American culture as a whole. John Alberti quotes [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]], who writes in her 1990s book ''Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices'', &quot;by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery,&quot; white scholars &quot;have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain's creative imagination at its core.&quot; It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and black culture in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/378621 John Alberti, &quot;The Nigger Huck: Race, Identity, and the Teaching of Huckleberry Finn,&quot; ''College English'' 57.8 (1995): 919–37, JSTOR, last modified February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illustrations ==
The original illustrations were done by [[E.W. Kemble]], at the time a young artist working for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Kemble was hand-picked by Twain, who admired his work. Hearn suggests that Twain and Kemble had a similar skill, writing that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever he may have lacked in technical grace ... Kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in a text his own distinct visual personality; just as Twain so deftly defined a full-rounded character in a few phrases, so too did Kemble depict with a few strokes of his pen that same entire personage.&lt;ref name=annothuck&gt;{{cite book|last=Twain|first=Mark (Samuel L.

As Kemble could afford only one model, most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork. When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper's and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.&lt;ref name=cope_uvlib&gt;{{cite web|last=Cope |first=Virginia H. |title=Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn: Text, Illustrations, and Early Reviews |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/huckfinn.html |publisher=University of Virginia Library |accessdate=17 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117125823/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/huckfinn.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication's effect on literary climate ==
[[File:Mark twain2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mark Twain]]]]

Twain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled ''Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography.'' Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the [[Hudson River]], Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade)''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain and Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Huckleberry Finn: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' (New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for [[Sotheby's]] books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, &quot;What you see is [Clemens'] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing&quot;. For example, Twain revised the opening line of ''Huck Finn'' three times. He initially wrote, &quot;You will not know about me&quot;, which he changed to, &quot;You do not know about me&quot;, before settling on the final version, &quot;You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Young, ''Ernest Hemingway: A Reconsideration'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State UP, 1966), 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/4613362 William Baker, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain,&quot; ''The Antioch Review'', . 54.3 (1996): 364–65, JSTOR, accessed April 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/books/first-half-of-huck-finn-in-twain-s-hand-is-found.html Rita Reif, &quot;First Half of 'Huck Finn,' in Twain's Hand, Is Found,&quot; ''The New York Times'', last modified February 17, 1991, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.&lt;ref&gt;William Baker, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for the book spread outside of the United States. ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was eventually published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baumanrarebooks.com/rare-books/twain-mark/adventures-of-huckleberry-finn/63515.aspx|title=Mark Twain – Adventures of Huckleberry Finn [sheep] First Edition – Bauman Rare Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble's picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps' groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Blair, ''Mark Twain &amp; Huck Finn'' (Berkeley: University of California, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All Modern Literature Comes from One Book by Mark Twain&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, the [[Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library|Buffalo Public Library's]] curator, James Fraser Gluck, approached Twain to donate the manuscript to the library. Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck's. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/books/antiques-how-huck-finn-was-rescued.html Rita Reif, &quot;ANTIQUES; How 'Huck Finn' Was Rescued,&quot; ''The New York Times'', last modified March 17, 1991, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the literary climate at the time of the book's publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain's already established reputation as a &quot;professional humorist&quot;, having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the &quot;dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation,&quot; ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' illustrated &quot;previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3823856 Henry N. Smith, &quot;The Publication of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;: A Centennial Retrospect,&quot; ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37.5 (1984): 18–40, JSTOR, accessed February 21, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[File:Jim and ghost huck finn.jpg|thumb|In this scene illustrated by [[E. W. Kemble]], Jim has given Huck up for dead and when he reappears thinks he must be a [[ghost]].]]

While it was clear that the publication of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was controversial from the outset, [[Norman Mailer]], writing in ''The New York Times'' in 1984, concluded that Twain's novel was not initially &quot;too unpleasantly regarded.&quot; In fact, Mailer writes: &quot;the critical climate could hardly anticipate [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[encomium]]s 50 years later,&quot; reviews that would remain longstanding in the American consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/09/books/mailer-huck.html Norman Mailer, &quot;Huckleberry Finn, Alive at 100,&quot; ''The New York Times'', last modified December 9, 1984, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book's challenges both dismissively and with confusion. During Twain's time, and today, defenders of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' &quot;lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and ‘censors' thus equating the complaints about the book's ‘coarseness' from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord Public Library]] in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot; /&gt;

Upon issue of the American edition in 1885 several libraries banned it from their shelves.&lt;ref name=&quot;leonard-concord&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=James S.|author2=Thomas A. Tenney |author3=Thadious M.

One incident was recounted in the newspaper the ''Boston Transcript'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Concord (Mass.) Public Library committee has decided to exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One member of the committee says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Fisher Fishkin, &quot;Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices&quot; (New York: Oxford UP, 1993) 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writer [[Louisa May Alcott]] criticized the book's publication as well, saying that if Twain &quot;[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1984/4/1984_4_81.shtml|title=One Hundred Years of Huck Finn|accessdate=November 8, 2010|last=Brown|first=Robert|work=American Heritage Magazine|publisher=AmericanHeritage.com|quote=If Mr. Clemens cannot think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/one-hundred-years-huck-finn|title=One Hundred Years Of Huck Finn – AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twain later remarked to his editor, &quot;Apparently, the Concord library has condemned Huck as 'trash and only suitable for the slums.' This will sell us another twenty-five thousand copies for sure!&quot;

In 1905, New York's [[Brooklyn Public Library]] also banned the book due to &quot;bad word choice&quot; and Huck's having &quot;not only itched but scratched&quot; within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: &lt;blockquote&gt;I am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' &amp; 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, &amp; it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, &amp; to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0105/The-n-word-gone-from-Huck-Finn-what-would-Mark-Twain-say Marjorie Kehe, &quot;The 'n'-word Gone from Huck Finn – What Would Mark Twain Say?

Many subsequent critics, [[Ernest Hemingway]] among them, have deprecated the final chapters, claiming the book &quot;devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy&quot; after Jim is detained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2006/02/01/mark-twain-vs-tom-sawyer Nick Gillespie, &quot;Mark Twain vs. Tom Sawyer: The Bold Deconstruction of a National Icon,&quot; ''Reason'', last modified February 2006, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hemingway declared, &quot;All modern American literature comes from&quot; ''Huck Finn'', and hailed it as &quot;the best book we've had&quot;, he cautioned, &quot;If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys {{sic}}.

== Controversy ==
In his introduction to ''The Annotated Huckleberry Finn'', [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] writes that Twain &quot;could be uninhibitedly vulgar&quot;, and quotes critic [[William Dean Howells]], a Twain contemporary, who wrote that the author's &quot;humor was not for most women&quot;. However, Hearn continues by explaining that &quot;the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain and Michael Patrick Hearn, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of modern scholarship of ''Huckleberry Finn'' has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Shelley Fisher Fishin, ''Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim.&lt;ref name=&quot;leonard-concord&quot; /&gt; According to Professor Stephen Railton of the [[University of Virginia]], Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to [[minstrel show]]-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1987/summer/railton-jim-mark/ Stephen Railton, &quot;Jim and Mark Twain: What Do Dey Stan' For?,&quot; ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', last modified 1987, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, [[CBS]] tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Sharp, &quot;Student Edition of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer Is Censored by Editor&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this controversy over whether ''Huckleberry Finn'' is racist or anti-racist, and because the word &quot;[[nigger]]&quot;  is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time which has since become vulgar and [[taboo]]), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school system—this questioning of the word &quot;nigger&quot; is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the &quot;most grotesque example of racism I've ever seen in my life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Brown, &quot;One Hundred Years of Huck Finn&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Library Association]], ''Huckleberry Finn'' was the fifth most frequently [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] book in the United States during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_1999|title=100 most frequently challenged books: 1990–1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]], Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word &quot;nigger&quot;. Clark filed a request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book, asking for the novel to be removed from the English curriculum. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Huck-Finn-a-masterpiece-or-an-insult-1130707.php Gregory Roberts, &quot;'Huck Finn' a Masterpiece -- or an Insult,&quot; ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', last modified November 25, 2003, accessed April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a Washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from a school curriculum. The teacher, John Foley, called for replacing ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' with a more modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/19/Wash-teacher-calls-for-Huck-Finn-ban/UPI-39901232395760/|title=Wash. teacher calls for 'Huck Finn' ban|date=January 19, 2009|work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion column that Foley wrote in the [[Seattle Post Intelligencer]], he states that all &quot;novels that use the ‘N-word' repeatedly need to go.&quot; He states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary, but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at &quot;just hear[ing] the N-word.&quot; He views this change as &quot;common sense,&quot; with Obama's election into office as a sign that Americans &quot;are ready for a change,&quot; and that by removing these books from the reading lists, they would be following this change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Guest-Columnist-Time-to-update-schools-reading-1296681.php John Foley, &quot;Guest Columnist: Time to Update Schools' Reading Lists,&quot; ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', last modified January 5, 2009, accessed April 13, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers of the book have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of less-coarse publications. A 2011 edition of the book, published by [[NewSouth Books]], [[Expurgation|replaced]] the word &quot;nigger&quot; with &quot;slave&quot; (although being incorrectly addressed to a freed man) and did not use the term &quot;Injun.&quot; Mark Twain scholar [[Alan Gribben]] said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms, rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/04/132652272/new-edition-of-huckleberry-finn-will-eliminate-offensive-words?ft=1|title=New Edition Of 'Huckleberry Finn' Will Eliminate Offensive Words|date=January 4, 2011|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to publisher Suzanne La Rosa &quot;At NewSouth, we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers. If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain's works will be more emphatically fulfilled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsouthbooks.com/pages/2011/01/04/a-word-about-the-newsouth-edition-of-mark-twains-tom-sawyer-and-huckleberry-finn/|title=A word about the NewSouth edition of Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn – NewSouth Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition &quot;doesn't challenge children to ask, 'Why would a child like Huck use such reprehensible language?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/new-editions-of-mark-twain-novels-to-remove-racial-slurs/story-e6frf96f-1225981589323 &quot;New Editions of Mark Twain Novels to Remove Racial Slurs,&quot; ''Herald Sun'', last modified January 4, 2011, accessed April 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' was removed from a public school district in [[Virginia]], along with the novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', due to their use of racial slurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Nick|title=To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn banned from schools in Virginia for racism|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/05/kill-mockingbird-huckleberry-finn-banned-schools-virginia-racism/|accessdate=29 December 2016|publisher=Telegraph|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books suspended by Va. school for racial slurs|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/to-kill-a-mockingbird-huckleberry-finn-suspended-by-virginia-school-for-racial-slurs/|accessdate=29 December 2016|publisher=CBS News|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to this include the publishing of ''[[The Hipster Huckleberry Finn]]'' which is an edition with the word &quot;nigger&quot; replaced with the word &quot;hipster&quot;.

[[File:ClavecinRuckers&amp;Taskin.JPG|thumb|right|300px|This harpsichord is the work of two celebrated makers:  originally constructed by [[Andreas Ruckers]] in Antwerp (1646), it was later remodeled and expanded by [[Pascal Taskin]] in Paris (1780).]]
A '''harpsichord''' is a [[musical instrument]] played by means of a [[musical keyboard|keyboard]], a row of levers which the player presses.  When the player presses one or more keys, this triggers a mechanism, which plucks one or more strings with a small quill.

&quot;Harpsichord&quot; designates the whole family of similar plucked keyboard instruments, including the smaller [[virginals]], [[virginals#Muselars|muselar]], and [[spinet]]. The harpsichord was widely used in [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]]. During the late 18th century, it gradually disappeared from the musical scene, with the rise of the [[piano]]. In the 20th century, it made a resurgence, being used in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, in new compositions, and in some styles of popular music.

==Mechanism==
[[File:MDMB 418, detall de clavicèmbal, Christian Zell, Museu de la Música de Barcelona.jpg|thumb|Detail of the mechanism of the Harpsichord by Christian Zell, at [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]]]
Harpsichords vary in size and shape, but all have the same basic mechanism. The player depresses a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key lifts a [[jack (organology)|jack]] (a long strip of wood) that holds a small [[plectrum]] (a wedge-shaped piece of [[quill]], often plastic in the 2010s), which plucks the string.  When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its rest position, and the jack falls back. The plectrum, mounted on a tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again.  As the key reaches its rest position, a felt damper atop the jack stops the string's vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below.

[[File:HarpsichordMechanism-EN.svg|center|thumb|800px|Figure 1. Schematic view of a 2 × 8&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; single manual harpsichord]]
* The ''keylever'' is a simple pivot, which rocks on a ''balance pin'' that passes through a hole drilled through the keylever.
* The ''jack'' is a thin, rectangular piece of wood that sits upright on the end of the keylever. The jacks are held in place by the ''registers''.  These are two long strips of wood (the upper movable, the lower fixed), which run in the gap between pinblock and bellyrail. The registers have rectangular mortises (holes) through which the jacks pass as they can move up and down. The registers hold the jacks in the precise location needed to pluck the string.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Jack diagram-EN.svg|center|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Upper part of a jack]]
* In the jack, a ''[[plectrum]]'' juts out almost horizontally (normally the plectrum is angled upwards a tiny amount) and passes just under the string. Historically, plectra were made of bird quill or leather; many modern harpsichords have plastic ([[delrin]] or [[celcon]]) plectra.
* When the front of the key is pressed, the back of the key rises,  the jack is lifted, and the plectrum plucks the string.
* The vertical motion of the jack is then stopped by the ''jackrail'' (also called the ''upper rail''), which is covered with soft felt to muffle the impact.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Harpsichord jack action.svg|center|thumb|700px|Figure 3:  how the harpsichord action works]]
* When the key is released, the jack falls back down under its own weight, and the plectrum passes back under the string. This is made possible by having the plectrum held in a tongue attached with a pivot and a spring to the body of the jack.  The bottom surface of the plectrum is cut at a slant; thus when the descending plectrum touches the string from above, the angled lower surface provides enough force to push the tongue backward.&lt;ref&gt;Kottick (1987, 19)&lt;/ref&gt;
* When the jack arrives in fully lowered position, the felt damper touches the string, causing the note to cease.

==Strings, tuning, and soundboard==
[[File:Resonance Chladni Soundboard Harpsichord Clavecin.jpg|thumb|right|Sound board of a harpsichord with [[Chladni]] patterns]]
[[File:035 Museu de la Música.jpg|thumb|Detail of the harpsichord by Karl Conrad Fleisher; Hamburg, 1720 in [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]. A decorative rose descends below the soundboard in which is it mounted; the soundboard itself is adorned with floral painting around the rose. The bridge is at lower right.]]
Each string is wound around a ''tuning pin'', normally at the end of the string closer to the player.  When rotated with a wrench or tuning hammer, the tuning pin adjusts the tension so that the string sounds the correct pitch.  Tuning pins are held tightly in holes drilled in the ''pinblock'' or ''wrestplank'', an oblong hardwood plank. Proceeding from the tuning pin, a string next passes over the ''nut'', a sharp edge that is made of hardwood and is normally attached to the wrestplank.  The section of the string beyond the nut forms its ''vibrating length'', which is plucked and creates sound.

At the other end of its vibrating length, the string passes over the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]], another sharp edge made of hardwood.  As with the nut, the horizontal position of the string along the bridge is determined by a vertical metal pin inserted into the bridge, against which the string rests. The bridge itself rests on a ''[[Sound board (music)|soundboard]]'', a thin panel of wood usually made of [[spruce]], [[fir]] or—in some Italian harpsichords—[[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]].  The soundboard efficiently transduces the vibrations of the strings into vibrations in the air; without a soundboard, the strings would produce only a very feeble sound. A string is attached at its far end by a loop to a ''hitchpin'' that secures it to the case.

==Multiple choirs of strings==
While many harpsichords have one string per note, more elaborate harpsichords can have two or more strings for each notes. When there are multiple strings for each note, these additional strings are called &quot;choirs&quot; of strings. This provides two advantages: the ability to vary volume and ability to vary tonal quality. Volume is increased when the mechanism of the instrument is set up by the player (see below) so that the press of a single key plucks more than one string. Tonal quality can be varied in two ways. First, different choirs of strings can be designed to have distinct tonal qualities, usually by having one set of strings plucked closer to the nut, which emphasizes the higher [[harmonic]]s, and produces a &quot;nasal&quot; sound quality. The mechanism of the instrument, called &quot;stops&quot; (following the use of the term in pipe organs) permits the player to select one choir or the other.  Second, having one key pluck two strings at once changes not just volume but also tonal quality; for instance, when two strings tuned to the same pitch are plucked simultaneously, the note is not just louder but also richer and more complex.

A particularly vivid effect is obtained when the strings plucked simultaneously are an [[octave]] apart. This is normally heard by the ear not as two pitches but as one:  the sound of the higher string is blended with that of the lower one, and the ear hears the lower pitch, enriched in tonal quality by the additional strength in the upper harmonics of the note sounded by the higher string.

When describing a harpsichord it is customary to specify its choirs of strings, often called its [[disposition (harpsichord)|disposition]].  Strings at [[eight foot pitch]] sound at the normal expected pitch, strings at four foot pitch sound an octave higher. Harpsichords occasionally include a sixteen-foot choir (one octave lower than eight-foot) or a two-foot choir (two octaves higher; quite rare). When there are multiple choirs of strings, the player is often able to control which choirs sound.  This is usually done by having a set of jacks for each choir, and a mechanism for &quot;turning off&quot; each set, often by moving the upper register (through which the jacks slide) sideways a short distance, so that their plectra miss the strings.  In simpler instruments this is done by manually moving the registers, but as the harpsichord evolved, builders invented levers, knee levers and pedal mechanisms to make it easier to change registration.

Harpsichords with more than one keyboard (this usually means two keyboards, stacked one on top of the other in a step-wise fashion, as with pipe organs)&lt;ref&gt;In virtually all instances, &quot;more than one&quot; means two. For the one known three-manual instrument, see [[Hieronymus Albrecht Hass]]. For forged three-manual instruments, see [[Leopoldo Franciolini]].&lt;/ref&gt; provide flexibility in selecting which strings play, since each manual can be set to control the plucking of a different set of strings. In addition, such harpsichords often have a mechanism (the &quot;coupler&quot;) that couples manuals together, so that a single manual plays both sets of strings. The most flexible system is the French &quot;shove coupler&quot;, in which the lower manual slides forward and backward. In the backward position, &quot;dogs&quot; attached to the upper surface of the lower manual engage the lower surface of the upper manual's keys.  Depending on choice of keyboard and coupler position, the player can select any of the sets of jacks labeled in figure 4 as A, or B and C, or all three.

[[File:Shove Coupler.svg|center|thumb|800px|Figure 4. French shove coupler. To the left: uncoupled keyboards. The depressed upper key lifts the jack A upwards. The depressed lower key lifts jacks B and C. To the right: The upper keyboard is coupled to the lower one by pulling the latter. The depressed upper key lifts the jack A upwards. The depressed lower key lifts jacks A, B and C.]]

The English &quot;dogleg&quot; jack system (also used in Baroque Flanders) does not require a coupler. The jacks labeled A in Figure 5 have a &quot;dogleg&quot; shape that permits either keyboard to play A. If the player wishes to play the upper 8' from the upper manual only and not from the lower manual, a stop handle disengages the jacks labeled A and engages instead an alternative row of jacks called &quot;lute stop&quot; (not shown in the Figure). A lute stop is used to imitate the gentle sound of a plucked [[lute]].&lt;ref&gt;Find full details in Hubbard 1967, pp. 133 ff., Russell 1973, pp. 65 ff. and Kottick 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dogleg shove coupler.svg|center|thumb|400px|Figure 5. Dogleg jack, English coupler system. When depressed, the upper key lifts the &quot;dogleg&quot; jack (jack A) upwards. The lower key lifts all three jacks A, B, and C.]] The use of multiple manuals in a harpsichord was not originally provided for the flexibility in choosing which strings would sound, but rather for [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of the instrument to play in different keys. For discussion, see ''[[History of the harpsichord]]''.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Lady Standing at a Virginal.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Vermeer]]'s famous painting ''[[Lady Standing at a Virginal]]'' shows a characteristic practice of his time, with the instrument mounted on a table and the player standing.]]

==Case==
The case holds in position all of the important structural members:  pinblock, soundboard, hitchpins, keyboard, and the jack action.  It usually includes a solid bottom, and also internal bracing to maintain its form without warping under the tension of the strings.  Cases vary greatly in weight and sturdiness:  Italian harpsichords are often of light construction; heavier construction is found in the later Flemish instruments and those derived from them (see ''[[History of the harpsichord]]'').

[[File:FalseInnerOuterHarpsichord.jpg|thumb|left|A false inner-outer harpsichord from the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]].  The false inner case begins to the right of the keyboard, and continues backward only far enough to provide a slot to support the jack rail.]]
The case also gives the harpsichord its external appearance and protects the instrument.  A large harpsichord is, in a sense, a piece of furniture, as it stands alone on legs and may be styled in the manner of other furniture of its place and period.  Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective outer case, and played after taking it out of its case and placing it on a table.&lt;ref name=Hubbard19&gt;Hubbard 1967, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Such tables were often quite high – until the late 18th century people usually played standing up.&lt;ref name=Hubbard19 /&gt;  Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed:  the ''false inner–outer'', which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the outer case contained an inner one, in the old style.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard 1967, 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.

Many harpsichords have a lid that can be raised, a cover for the keyboard, and a stand for music.

Harpsichords have been decorated in a great many different ways: with plain buff paint (e.g. some Flemish instruments), with paper printed with patterns, with leather or velvet coverings, with [[chinoiserie]], or occasionally with highly elaborate painted artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard 1967, various locations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Arley Hall]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

===Harpsichord===
In modern usage, &quot;harpsichord&quot; can mean any member of the family of instruments.  More often, though, it specifically denotes a [[grand piano|grand-piano]]-shaped instrument with a roughly triangular case accommodating long [[bass (sound)|bass]] strings at the left and short [[Clef|treble]] strings at the right.  The characteristic profile of such a harpsichord is more elongated than a modern piano, with a sharper curve to the [[bentside]].

===Virginals===
{{Main article|Virginals}}
The virginal is a smaller and simpler rectangular form of the harpsichord having only one string per note; the strings run parallel to the keyboard, which is on the long side of the case.

===Spinet===
{{Main article|Spinet}}
A spinet is a harpsichord with the strings set at an angle (usually about 30 degrees) to the keyboard.  The strings are too close together for the jacks to fit between them.  Instead, the strings are arranged in pairs, and the jacks are in the larger gaps between the pairs.  The two jacks in each gap face in opposite directions, and each plucks a string adjacent to the gap.

The English diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] mentions his &quot;tryangle&quot; several times. This was not the percussion instrument that we call [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] today; rather, it was a name for octave-pitched spinets, which were triangular in shape.

===Clavicytherium===
{{Main article|Clavicytherium}}
A clavicytherium is a harpsichord with the soundboard and strings mounted vertically facing the player, the same space-saving principle as an [[upright piano]].&lt;ref name=UEMI138&gt;Dearling 1996, 138&lt;/ref&gt; In a clavicytherium, the jacks move horizontally without the assistance of gravity, so that clavicytherium actions are more complex than those of other harpsichords.

[[File:DolmetschSpinet LateWinter.jpg|thumb|left|An ottavino built by Arnold Dolmetsch in 1923, and modeled after a 1698 instrument by Joannes Carcassi]]

===Ottavino===
Ottavini are small spinets or virginals at [[Eight foot pitch|four foot pitch]]. Harpsichords at octave pitch were more common in the early Renaissance, but lessened in popularity later on. However, the ottavino remained very popular as a domestic instrument in Italy until the 19th century. In the Low Countries, an ottavino was commonly paired with an [[Eight foot pitch|8']] virginals, encased in a small cubby under the soundboard of the larger instrument. The ottavino could be removed and placed on top of the virginal, making in effect a double manual instrument. These are sometimes called 'mother-and-child'&lt;ref&gt;Kottick (2003, 61)&lt;/ref&gt; or 'double' virginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Byron's letters and journals: 1816–1817 : 'So late into the night' |last=Marchand |first=Leslie Alexis |year=1973 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-08945-7 |page=75 }} &quot;Model IX is the famous double virginal. An ottavino of model VIII is inserted into the case of the virginal like a drawer slipping into a bureau.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The [[archicembalo]], built in the 16th century, had an unusual keyboard layout, designed to accommodate variant [[Musical tuning|tuning systems]] demanded by compositional practice and theoretical experimentation.  More common were instruments with [[split sharp]]s, also designed to accommodate the tuning systems of the time.

The [[folding harpsichord]] was an instrument that could be folded up for travel.

Pedal Harpsichord: Occasionally, harpsichords were built which included another set or sets of strings underneath and operated by pedals which pluck the lowest keys of the harpsichord. Although there are no known extant pedal harpsichords from the 18th century or before, from Adlung (1758): the lower set of usually 8' strings  &quot;...is built like an ordinary harpsichord, but with an extent of two octaves only. The jacks are similar, but they will benefit from being arranged back to back, since the two [bass] octaves take as much space as four in an ordinary harpsichord&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/pedal/pedalharpsichord.htm |title=Pedal Harpsichords |publisher=Harpsichord.org.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523193530/http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/pedal/pedalharpsichord.htm |archivedate=23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1980 when Keith Hill introduced his design for a pedal harpsichord, most pedal harpsichords were built based on the designs of extant pedal pianos from the 19th century, in which the instrument is as wide as the pedalboard.  While these were mostly intended as practice instruments for organists{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}, a few pieces are believed to have been written specifically for the pedal harpsichord.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} However, the set of pedals can augment the sound from any piece performed on the instrument, as demonstrated on several albums by [[E. Power Biggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsbach.org/biggsbachonthepedalharpsichord.html |title=Bach on the Pedal Harpsichord by E. Power Biggs at |publisher=Jsbach.org |date=20 May 1995 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compass and pitch range===
On the whole, earlier harpsichords have smaller [[range (music)|ranges]] than later ones, although there are many exceptions.  The largest harpsichords have a range of just over five [[octave]]s, and the smallest have under four. Usually, the shortest keyboards were given extended range in the bass with a &quot;[[short octave]]&quot;. The traditional pitch range for a 5-octave instrument is F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (FF–f‴).

Tuning pitch is often taken to be A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;415&amp;nbsp;Hz, roughly a semitone lower than the modern standard concert pitch of A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;440&amp;nbsp;Hz. An accepted exception is for French baroque repertoire, which is often performed with a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;392&amp;nbsp;Hz, approximately a semitone lower again. See [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Traité de l'harmonie réduite à ses principes naturels|Treatise on Harmony]]'' (1722) [Dover Publications], Book One, chapter five, for insight into French baroque tuning; &quot;Since most of these semitones are absolutely necessary in the tuning of organs and other similar instruments, the following chromatic system has been drawn up.&quot;  Tuning an instrument nowadays usually starts with setting an A; historically it would commence from a C or an F.

Some modern instruments are built with keyboards that can shift sideways, allowing the player to align the mechanism with strings at either A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;415&amp;nbsp;Hz or A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;440&amp;nbsp;Hz.  If a tuning other than equal temperament is used, the instrument requires retuning once the keyboard is shifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubharp.com/technical_articles2/soundboard_transposingkeyboard.htm |title=The Transposing Keyboard |publisher=Hubharp.com |date= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harpsichord was most likely invented in the late Middle Ages.  By the 16th century, harpsichord makers in Italy were making lightweight instruments with low string tension.  A different approach was taken in the [[Southern Netherlands]] starting in the late 16th century, notably by the [[Ruckers]] family.  Their harpsichords used a heavier construction and produced a more powerful and distinctive tone.  They included the first harpsichords with two keyboards, used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]].

The Flemish instruments served as the model for 18th century harpsichord construction in other nations.  In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument.  Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.  In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority.  German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] and [[eight foot pitch|two foot]] choirs; these instruments have recently served as models for modern builders.

In the late 18th century the harpsichord was supplanted by the [[piano]] and almost disappeared from view for most of the 19th century: an exception was its continued use in opera for accompanying [[recitative]], but the piano sometimes displaced it even there.  Twentieth century efforts to revive the harpsichord began with instruments that used piano technology, with heavy strings and metal frames.  Starting in the middle of the 20th century, ideas about harpsichord making underwent a major change, when builders such as [[Frank Hubbard]], [[William Dowd]], and [[Martin Skowroneck]] sought to re-establish the building traditions of the Baroque period.  Harpsichords of this type of historically informed building practice dominate the current scene.

==Music==

===Historical period===
[[File:Bachbwv933.ogg|thumb|Bach's [[Six Little Preludes (Bach)#Little Prelude in C major, BWV 933|Little Prelude in C major]] being played on a harpsichord]]
The great bulk of the standard repertoire for the harpsichord was written during its first historical flowering, the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras.

The first music written specifically for solo harpsichord was published around the early 16th century. Composers who wrote solo harpsichord music were numerous during the whole Baroque era in European countries including Italy, Germany, England and France.  Solo harpsichord compositions included dance [[suite (music)|suites]], [[fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[fugue]]s.  Among the most famous composers who wrote for the harpsichord were the members of [[virginalist|English virginal school]] of the late Renaissance, notably [[William Byrd]] (ca. 1540 – 1623).  In France, a great number of highly characteristic solo works were created and compiled into four books of ''ordres'' by [[François Couperin]] (1668–1733). [[Domenico Scarlatti]] (1685–1757) began his career in Italy but wrote most of his solo harpsichord works in Spain; his most famous work is his series of [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|555 harpsichord sonatas]].  Perhaps the most celebrated composer who wrote for the harpsichord was [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750), whose solo works (for instance, the [[Well-Tempered Clavier]] and the [[Goldberg Variations]]), continue to be performed very widely, often on the piano.  Bach was also a pioneer of the harpsichord concerto, both in [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)|works]] designated as such, and in the harpsichord part of his [[Brandenburg concertos|Fifth Brandenburg Concerto]].

Two of the most prominent composers of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]], [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791), wrote harpsichord music.  For both, the instrument featured in the earlier period of their careers and was abandoned once they had shifted their efforts to the piano.

===Music written for the revived instrument===
{{main article|Contemporary harpsichord}}
Through the 19th century, the harpsichord was almost completely supplanted by the piano. In the 20th century, composers returned to the instrument, as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the [[harpsichordist]]s [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] (1872–1951) and in France, [[Wanda Landowska]] (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance. [[Harpsichord concerto|Concertos]] for the instrument were written by [[Francis Poulenc]] (the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'', 1927–28), and [[Manuel de Falla]].  [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Double Concerto'' is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber [[orchestra]]s. For a detailed account of music composed for the revived harpsichord, see ''Contemporary harpsichord''.

'''Hair''' is a [[protein filament]] that grows from [[hair follicle|follicles]] found in the [[dermis]], the innermost layer of the skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of [[mammal]]s.
The human body, apart from areas of [[Glabrous skin#Glabrous skin|glabrous skin]], is covered in follicles which produce thick [[terminal hair|terminal]] and fine [[vellus hair]]. Most common interest in hair is focused on [[hair growth]], hair types and [[hair care]], but hair is also an important [[biomaterial]] primarily composed of protein, notably [[alpha-keratin]].

Attitudes towards different hair, such as [[hairstyle]]s and [[hair removal]], vary widely across different cultures and historical periods, but it is often used to indicate a person's personal beliefs or social position, such as their age, sex, or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria|title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=88 Post Road West, Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-33145-6|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The word &quot;hair&quot; usually refers to two distinct structures: 
#the part beneath the skin, called the hair follicle, or, when pulled from the skin, the bulb. This organ is located in the [[dermis]] and maintains stem cells, which not only re-grow the hair after it falls out, but also are recruited to regrow skin after a wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Krause|first1= K|last2= Foitzik|first2= K|title= Biology of the Hair Follicle: The Basics|journal= Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery|volume= 25|issue= 1|pages= 2–10|year= 2006|doi= 10.1016/j.sder.2006.01.002|pmid= 16616298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the shaft, which is the hard filamentous part that extends above the skin surface. A cross section of the hair shaft may be divided roughly into three zones.

Hair fibers have a structure consisting of several layers, starting from the outside:
# the [[Cuticle (hair)|cuticle]], which consists of several layers of flat, thin cells laid out overlapping one another as roof shingles,
# the [[Cortex (hair)|cortex]], which contains the [[keratin]] bundles in cell structures that remain roughly rod-like.
# the [[Medulla (hair)|medulla]], a disorganized and open area at the fiber's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Feughelman, Max |title=Mechanical Properties and Structure of Alpha-keratin Fibres: Wool, Human Hair and Related Fibres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSNIYKwKu8kC|year=1997|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-359-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cortex contains [[melanin]], which colors the fiber based on the number, distribution and types of melanin granules. The shape of the follicle determines the shape of the cortex, and the shape of the fiber is related to how straight or curly the hair is. People with straight hair have round hair fibers. Oval and other shaped fibers are generally more wavy or curly. The cuticle is the outer covering. Its complex structure slides as the hair swells and is covered with a single molecular layer of lipid that makes the hair repel water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hair Structure and Hair Life Cycle&quot;/&gt; The diameter of human hair varies from {{convert|0.017|to|0.18|mm|sp=us|lk=in }}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ley |first=Brian |title=Diameter of a Human Hair |year=1999 |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml |accessdate=28 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qpTnR6HP |archivedate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two million small, tubular glands and sweat glands that produce watery fluids that cool the body by evaporation.

Hair growth begins inside the [[hair follicle]]. The only &quot;living&quot; portion of the hair is found in the follicle. The hair that is visible is the hair shaft, which exhibits no biochemical activity and is considered &quot;dead&quot;. The base of a hair's root (the &quot;bulb&quot;) contains the cells that produce the hair shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Freinkel, R.K. |editor2=Woodley, D.T. |title=The Biology of the Skin |date=15 March 2001 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9781850700067 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other structures of the hair follicle include the oil producing [[sebaceous gland]] which lubricates the hair and the [[arrector pili]] muscles, which are responsible for causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body hair, the effect results in [[goose bumps]].

The ''root of the hair'' ends in an enlargement, the ''hair bulb'', which is whiter in color and softer in texture than the shaft, and is lodged in a follicular involution of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] called the [[hair follicle]]. Bulb of hair layers consist of fibrous connective tissue, glassy membrane, external root sheath, internal root sheath composed of epithelium stratum ([[Henle's layer]]) and granular stratum ([[Huxley's layer]]), cuticle, cortex and medulla of hair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/skin/hair.php Histology Guide | Skin].

===Natural color===
{{main article|Human hair color}}
[[File:Brown hair.jpg|thumb|A woman with dark blonde hair, the basal color appears brown due to higher levels of brownish eumelanin.]]
All natural hair colors are the result of two types of hair pigments. Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the fibers. [[Eumelanin]] is the dominant pigment in [[brown hair]] and [[black hair]], while [[pheomelanin]] is dominant in [[red hair]]. [[Blond hair]] is the result of having little [[pigmentation]] in the hair strand. [[Gray hair]] occurs when melanin production decreases or stops, while [[poliosis]] is hair (and often the skin to which the hair is attached), typically in spots, that never possessed melanin at all in the first place, or ceased for natural genetic reasons, generally, in the first years of life.

===Human hair growth===
{{main article|Human hair growth}}
Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and [[Glabrous skin#Glabrous skin|glabrous skin]], such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.

Hair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: [[anagen]], [[catagen]], and [[telogen]] phases. Each has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the telogen phase.

The body has different types of hair, including [[vellus hair]] and [[androgenic hair]], each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection.

===Texture===
[[File:OrangeCat hair.jpg|thumb|Orange [[American Shorthair|American shorthair]] cat.]]
Hair exists in a variety of textures. Three main aspects of hair texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. The derivations of hair texture are not fully understood. All mammalian hair is composed of [[keratin]], so the make-up of [[hair follicles]] is not the source of varying hair patterns. There are a range of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of hair. Scientists have come to believe that the shape of the [[hair shaft]] has an effect on the curliness of the individual's hair. A very round shaft allows for fewer [[disulfide bonds]] to be present in the hair strand. This means the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in straight hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson genomics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/2011/Piper/Background.html |title=Curly Hair Gene |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flatter the hair shaft becomes, the curlier hair gets, because the shape allows more [[cysteine]]s to become compacted together resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond, becomes curlier in form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson genomics&quot;/&gt; As the hair follicle shape determines curl pattern, the hair follicle size determines thickness. While the circumference of the hair follicle expands, so does the thickness of the hair follicle. An individual's hair volume, as a result, can be thin, normal, or thick. The consistency of hair can almost always be grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is determined by the hair follicle volume and the condition of the strand.&lt;ref name=&quot;hairdressing.ac.uk 153&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |title=Hair type, texture and density &amp;#124; Hairdressing Training |publisher=Hairdressing.ac.uk |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine hair has the smallest circumference, coarse hair has the largest circumference, and medium hair is anywhere between the other two.&lt;ref name=&quot;hairdressing.ac.uk 153&quot;/&gt; Coarse hair has a more open cuticle than thin or medium hair causing it to be the most porous.&lt;ref name=&quot;hairdressing.ac.uk 153&quot;/&gt;

====Classification systems====
There are various systems that people use to classify their curl patterns. Being knowledgeable of an individual's hair type is a good start to knowing how to take care of one's hair. There is not just one method to discovering one's hair type. Additionally it is possible, and quite normal to have more than one kind of hair type, for instance having a mixture of both type 3a &amp; 3b curls. 
; {{resize|105%|Andre Walker system}}
This hair typing system is the most widely used system to classify hair. The system was created by the hairstylist of [[Oprah Winfrey]], Andre Walker. According to this system there are four types of hair: straight, wavy, curly, kinky.
* Type 1 is [[straight hair]], which reflects the most sheen and also the most resilient hair of all of the hair types. It is hard to damage and immensely difficult to curl this hair texture. Because the [[sebum]] easily spreads from the scalp to the ends without curls or kinks to interrupt its path, it is the most oily hair texture of all.
* Type 2 is wavy hair, whose texture and sheen ranges somewhere between straight and curly hair. Wavy hair is also more likely to become [[frizz]]y than straight hair. While type A waves can easily alternate between straight and curly styles, type B and C Wavy hair is resistant to styling.
* Type 3 is [[curly hair]] known to have an S-shape. The curl pattern may resemble a lowercase &quot;s&quot;, uppercase &quot;S&quot;, or sometimes an uppercase &quot;Z&quot; or lowercase &quot;z&quot;.{{Citation needed|reason=this is suspect (or confusing) because the uppercase &quot;S&quot; has the same shape and the lowercase variety|date=September 2016}} This hair type is usually voluminous, &quot;climate dependent ([[humidity]] = frizz), and damage prone.&quot; Lack of proper care causes less defined curls.
* Type 4 is [[kinky hair]], which features a tightly coiled curl pattern (or no discernible curl pattern at all) that is often fragile with a very high density. This type of hair shrinks when wet and because it has fewer cuticle layers than other hair types it is more susceptible to damage.

==Functions==
Many mammals have [[fur]] and other hairs that serve different functions. Hair provides thermal regulation and [[camouflage]] for many animals; for others it provides signals to other animals such as warnings, mating, or other communicative displays; and for some animals hair provides defensive functions and, rarely, even offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.

===Warmth===
[[File:Ursus maritimus Steve Amstrup.jpg|thumb|left|Polar bears use their fur for warmth and while their skin is black, their transparent fur appears white and provides camouflage while hunting and serves as protection by hiding cubs in the snow.]]

While humans have developed clothing and other means of keeping warm, the hair found on the head serves as primary sources of heat [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]], but the hair on the human body does help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is too cold, the [[arrector pili]] muscles found attached to hair follicles stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. This process is formally called [[piloerection]], derived from the Latin words 'pilus' ('hair') and 'erectio' ('rising up'), but is more commonly known as 'having [[goose bumps]]' in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why Do Humans Get goosebumps When They Are Cold, or under Other Circumstances?: Scientific American.&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bubenik|first=George A.|date=1 September 2003|title=Why do humans get &quot;goosebumps&quot; when they are cold, or under other circumstances?|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the arrector muscles make the hair lie flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.

===Protection===
In some mammals, such as [[hedgehog]]s and [[porcupine]]s, the hairs have been modified into hard spines or quills. These are covered with thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair such as that of the lion's mane and grizzly bear's fur do offer some protection from physical damages such as bites and scratches.

===Touch sense===
Displacement and vibration of hair shafts are detected by hair follicle nerve receptors and nerve receptors within the skin. Hairs can sense movements of air as well as touch by physical objects and they provide sensory awareness of the presence of [[ectoparasites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0987| pmid = 22171023| title = Human fine body hair enhances ectoparasite detection| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 358–61| year = 2011| last1 = Dean | first1 = I.| last2 = Siva-Jothy | first2 = M.

====Eyebrows and eyelashes====
[[File:Eyelashes.jpg|thumb|right|Eyelashes and eyebrows help to protect the eyes from dust, dirt, and sweat.]]

The [[eyebrow]]s provide moderate protection to the [[eye]]s from [[dirt]], [[sweat]] and [[rain]]. They also play a key role in non-verbal [[communication]] by displaying emotions such as sadness, anger, surprise and excitement. In many other mammals, they contain much longer, whisker-like hairs that act as tactile sensors.

The [[eyelash]] grows at the edges of the eyelid and protects the eye from dirt. The [[eyelash]] is to humans, camels, horses, ostriches etc., what [[whiskers]] are to [[cat]]s; they are used to sense when dirt, [[dust]], or any other potentially harmful object is too close to the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thumbprints - The Human Eyelash.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ion.asu.edu/liv41_eyelash/liv41_thumb.htm |title=Images of Nature |publisher=Ion.asu.edu |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye reflexively closes as a result of this [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]].

==Evolution==
Hair has its origins in the common ancestor of mammals, the [[synapsid]]s, about 300 million years ago. It is currently unknown at what stage the synapsids acquired mammalian characteristics such as [[body hair]] and [[mammary gland]]s, as the [[fossil]]s only rarely provide direct evidence for soft tissues. Skin impression of the belly and lower tail of a [[pelycosaur]], possibly ''[[Haptodus]]'' shows the basal synapsid stock bore transverse rows of rectangular [[scute]]s, similar to those of a modern [[crocodile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niedźwiedzki|first1=Grzegorz|last2=Bojanowski|first2=Maciej|title=A Supposed Eupelycosaur Body Impression from the Early Permian of the Intra-Sudetic Basin, Poland|journal=Ichnos|date=July 2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=150–155|doi=10.1080/10420940.2012.702549|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10420940.2012.702549|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exceptionally well-preserved skull of ''[[Estemmenosuchus]]'', a [[therapsid]] from the [[Upper Permian]], shows smooth, hairless skin with what appears to be glandular depressions,&lt;ref&gt;Kardong, K.V.

McGraw-Hill, New York&lt;/ref&gt; though as a semi-aquatic species it might not have been particularly useful to determine the integument of terrestrial species. The oldest undisputed known fossils showing unambiguous imprints of hair are the [[Callovian]] (late middle [[Jurassic]]) ''[[Castorocauda]]'' and several contemporary [[haramiyida]]ns, both [[Mammaliformes|near-mammal]] [[cynodont]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;JiLuoYuanTabrumCastorocauda&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Q.

Some modern mammals have a special gland in front of each [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] used to preen the fur, called the [[harderian gland]]. Imprints of this structure is found in the skull of the small early mammals like ''[[Morganucodon]]'', but not in their [[cynodont]] ancestors like ''[[Thrinaxodon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lingham-Soliar|first1=Theagarten|title=The vertebrate integument, Vol I|date=2014|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-53748-6|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hairs of the fur in modern animals are all connected to nerves, and so the fur also serves as a transmitter  for sensory input. Fur could have evolved from sensory hair (whiskers). The signals from this sensory apparatus is interpreted in the [[neocortex]], a chapter of the brain that expanded markedly in animals like ''Morganucodon'' and ''[[Hadrocodium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowe|first1=T.

===Human hairlessness===

The general hairlessness of humans in comparison to related species may be due to loss of functionality in the pseudogene KRTHAP1 (which helps produce keratin) in the human lineage about 240,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In order to comprehend why humans are essentially hairless, it is essential to understand that mammalian body hair is not merely an aesthetic characteristic; it protects the skin from wounds, bites, heat, cold, and UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rantala|first=M. J.|title=Human nakedness: Adaptation against ectoparasites?|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|year=1999|volume=29|pages=1987–1989|doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(99)00133-2|pmid=10961855|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it can be used as a communication tool and as a camouflage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonski 2010 8962–8968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jablonski|first1=N.

Humans are the only primate species that have undergone significant hair loss and of the approximately 5000 extant species of mammal, only a handful are effectively hairless. This list includes elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, walruses, some species of [[pig]]s, whales and other [[cetaceans]], and naked mole rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonski 2010 8962–8968&quot;/&gt; Most mammals have light skin that is covered by fur, and biologists believe that early human ancestors started out this way also. Dark skin probably evolved after humans lost their body fur, because the naked skin was vulnerable to the strong [[UV radiation]] as explained in the [[Out of Africa hypothesis]]. Therefore, evidence of the time when human skin darkened has been used to date the loss of human body hair, assuming that the dark skin was needed after the fur was gone.
It was expected that dating the split of the ancestral human louse into two species, the [[head louse]] and the [[pubic louse]], would date the loss of body hair in human ancestors. However, it turned out that the human pubic louse does not descend from the ancestral human louse, but from the [[gorilla louse]], diverging 3.3 million years ago. This suggests that humans had lost body hair (but retained head hair) and developed thick pubic hair prior to this date, were living in or close to the forest where gorillas lived, and acquired pubic lice from butchering gorillas or sleeping in their nests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-gorilla-lice.html |title=Gorillas Gave Pubic Lice to Humans, DNA Study Reveals |work=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Biol |date=10 February 2009 |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=20 |title=Apes, lice and prehistory |author=Weiss RA |pmid=19232074 |pmc=2687769 |doi=10.1186/jbiol114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vulpes vulpes sitting.jpg|thumb|The soft, fine hair found on many nonhuman mammals is typically called fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/40/40_4/Bergman.htm|title=Why Mammal Body Hair Is an Evolutionary Enigma |journal=Creation Research Society Quarterly Journal |year=2014|volume =50|issue=3|page=216|author=Bergman, Jerry }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sweat glands in humans could have evolved to spread from the hands and feet as the body hair changed, or the hair change could have occurred to facilitate sweating. Horses and humans are two of the few animals capable of sweating on most of their body, yet horses are larger and still have fully developed fur. In humans, the skin hairs lie flat in hot conditions, as the arrector pili muscles relax, preventing heat from being trapped by a layer of still air between the hairs, and increasing heat loss by convection.

Another hypothesis for the thick [[body hair]] on humans proposes that [[Fisherian runaway]] [[sexual selection]] played a role (as well as in the selection of long head hair), (see [[#Types of hair|types of hair]] and [[vellus hair]]), as well as a much larger role of testosterone in men. Sexual selection is the only theory thus far that explains the [[sexual dimorphism]] seen in the hair patterns of men and women. On average, men have more [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] than women. Males have more [[terminal hair]], especially on the [[facial hair|face]], [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdomen]], and back, and females have more [[vellus hair]], which is less visible. The halting of hair development at a juvenile stage, vellus hair, would also be consistent with the [[neoteny]] evident in humans, especially in females, and thus they could have occurred at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Dixson, A.F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VRTniKE2liYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sexual Selection and the Origins of Human Mating Systems].'' Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (2009) {{ISBN|0-19-955942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, however, has significant holdings in today's cultural norms. There is no evidence that sexual selection would proceed to such a drastic extent over a million years ago when a full, lush coat of hair would most likely indicate health and would therefore be more likely to be selected ''for'', not against, and not all human populations today have sexual dimorphism in body hair.

A further hypothesis is that human hair was reduced in response to [[ectoparasites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pagel&amp;Bodmer2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003 |author1=Pagel, Mark  |author2=Bodmer, Walter |title=A naked ape would have fewer parasites |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society|Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |pmid=12952654 |volume=270 |pages= S117–S119 |pmc=1698033 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0041|issue=Suppl 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10961855|last1=Rantala|first1=MJ|year=1999|pages=1987–9|issue=12|volume=29|title=Human nakedness: adaptation against ectoparasites?|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|url=http://users.utu.fi/mjranta/reprints/1.%20Rantala1999.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(99)00133-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;ectoparasite&quot; explanation of modern human nakedness is based on the principle that a hairless primate would harbor fewer parasites.  When our ancestors adopted group-dwelling social arrangements roughly 1.8 mya, ectoparasite loads increased dramatically. Early humans became the only one of the 193 primate species to have [[fleas]], which can be attributed to the close living arrangements of large groups of individuals. While primate species have communal sleeping arrangements, these groups are always on the move and thus are less likely to harbor ectoparasites. Because of this, selection pressure for early humans would favor decreasing body hair because those with thick coats would have more lethal-disease-carrying ectoparasites and would thereby have lower fitness. However, early humans were able to compensate for the loss of warmth and protection provided by body hair with clothing, and no other mammal lost body hair to reduce parasite loads.

Another view is proposed by [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]], who attempts to explain hairlessness as evolved from the relationship between mother and child, and as a consequence of [[bipedalism]]. Giles also connects romantic love to hairlessness.&lt;ref name=shea&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea |first=Christopher |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/07/12/human-hairlessness-the-naked-love-explanation/ |title=Human Hairlessness: The ‘Naked Love’ Explanation – Ideas Market – WSJ |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis is that humans' use of fire caused or initiated the reduction in human hair.&lt;ref name=couch&gt;{{cite web|last=Couch |first=Alan |url=https://peerj.com/preprints/1702/?td=wk |title=Fur or Fire: Was the use of fire the initial selection pressure for fur loss in ancestral hominins?|work=PeerJ PrePrints 4:e1702v1|date=3 February 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2016|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.1702v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary variation===
Evolutionary biologists suggest that the genus ''[[Homo]]'' arose in [[East Africa]] approximately 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Jablonski06&gt;{{cite book|author=Jablonski, Nina G. |title=Skin: A Natural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYi9S3VtIGsC&amp;pg=PP13|date=1 May 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94170-0|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They devised new hunting techniques.&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt; The higher protein diet led to the evolution of larger body and brain sizes.&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt; Jablonski&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt; postulates that increasing body size, in conjunction with intensified hunting during the day at the equator, gave rise to a greater need to rapidly expel heat. As a result, humans evolved the ability to sweat: a process which was facilitated by the loss of body hair.&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt; A major problem with this theory{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}, however, is that it does not explain why males are larger, hairier, and were more active in hunting than females. The female-male size differential among other closely associated primates is much greater than among humans, and therefore it was reduced during human evolution.
Other primates have sweat gland in their armpits that function as those of humans, and thus it is probable that human sweat glands evolved from a similar distribution, spreading to more areas of the body, rather than occurring through evolution of a new trait. It is not known whether the increased distribution of sweat glands occurred before, during, or after, the change in body hair, or even whether the two are related developments. Horses also sweat, and they are larger, hairier, and expend more energy running than human males, so there may not be any connection between the ability to sweat and the apparent hairlessness of humans.

Another factor in human evolution that also occurred in the prehistoric past was a preferential selection for [[neoteny]], particularly in females. The idea that adult humans exhibit certain neotenous (juvenile) features, not evinced in the great apes, is about a century old. [[Louis Bolk]] made a long list of such traits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bolk|first=L.|year=1926|title=Das Problem der Menschwerdung|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a short list in ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;short-list of 25 characters reprinted in Gould, Stephen Jay (1977). ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and phylogeny]]''. Harvard University Press. p. 357. {{ISBN|0674639413}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[paedomorphic]] characteristics in women are often [[Physical attractiveness#Determinants of female physical attractiveness|acknowledged as desirable by men]] in [[Psychology#Contemporary issues in methodology and practice|developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott|first1=  Isabel M.|date=October 7, 2014 |title=Human preferences for sexually dimorphic faces may be evolutionarily novel |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/40/14388.abstract |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111 |issue=40 |pages= 14388–14393|doi=10.1073/pnas.1409643111 |access-date=April 18, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[vellus hair]] is a juvenile characteristic. However, while men develop longer, coarser, thicker, and darker [[terminal hair]] through [[sexual differentiation]], women do not, leaving their vellus hair visible.

====Curly hair====

{{Refimprove|date=August 2016}}
Jablonski&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt; asserts head hair was evolutionarily advantageous for pre-humans to retain because it protected the scalp as they walked upright in the intense African (equatorial) [[UV light]]. While some might argue that, by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions, the protection of the head, the seat of the brain that enabled humanity to become one of the most successful species on the planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the gradual process by which ''Homo erectus'' began a transition from furry skin to the naked skin expressed by Homo sapiens, hair texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} (the condition of most mammals, including humanity's closest cousins—chimpanzees) to [[Afro-textured hair]] or 'kinky' (i.e. tightly coiled). This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids living at the equator). It is substantiated by Iyengar's (1998) findings that UV light can enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when kinked or sharply curved or coiled).  In this sense, when hominids (i.e. Homo Erectus) were gradually losing their straight body hair and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability.  By inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-protected skin to paler skin.

Some {{Who|date=August 2016}} conversely believe that tightly coiled hair that grows into a typical Afro-like formation would have greatly reduced the ability of the head and brain to cool because although African people's hair is much less dense than its European counterpart's, in the intense sun the effective 'woolly hat' that such hair produced would have been a disadvantage. However, such anthropologists as [[Nina Jablonski]] oppositely argue about this hair texture. Specifically, Jablonski's assertions&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt;  suggest that the adjective &quot;woolly&quot; in reference to Afro-hair is a [[misnomer]] in connoting the high heat insulation derivable from the true wool of sheep. Instead, the relatively sparse density of Afro-hair, combined with its springy coils actually results in an airy, almost sponge-like structure that in turn, Jablonski argues,&lt;ref name=Jablonski06/&gt; more likely facilitates an increase in the circulation of cool air onto the scalp. Further, wet Afro-hair does not stick to the neck and scalp unless totally drenched and instead tends to retain its basic springy puffiness because it less easily responds to moisture and sweat than straight hair does. In this sense, the trait may enhance comfort levels in intense equatorial climates more than straight hair (which, on the other hand, tends to naturally fall over the ears and neck to a degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels in cold climates relative to tightly coiled hair).

Further, some {{Who|date=August 2016}} interpret the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] as suggesting that some traits, such as hair texture, were so arbitrary to human survival that the role natural selection played was trivial. Hence, they argue in favor of his suggestion that sexual selection may be responsible for such traits. However, inclinations towards deeming hair texture &quot;adaptively trivial&quot; may root in certain cultural value judgments more than objective logic.  In this sense the possibility that hair ''texture'' may have played an adaptively significant role cannot be completely eliminated from consideration. In fact, while the sexual selection hypothesis cannot be ruled out, the asymmetrical distribution of this trait vouches for environmental influence. Specifically, if hair texture were simply the result of adaptively arbitrary human aesthetic preferences, one would expect that the global distribution of the various hair textures would be fairly random.  Instead, the distribution of Afro-hair is strongly skewed toward the equator. Further, it is notable that the most pervasive expression of this hair texture can be found in sub-Saharan Africa; a region of the world that abundant genetic and paleo-anthropological evidence suggests, was the relatively recent (~200,000-year-old) point of origin for modern humanity. In fact, although genetic findings (Tishkoff, 2009) suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are the most genetically diverse continental group on Earth, [[Afro-textured hair]] approaches ubiquity in this region. This points to a strong, long-term selective pressure that, in stark contrast to most other regions of the genomes of sub-Saharan groups, left little room for genetic variation at the determining loci. Such a pattern, again, does not seem to support human sexual aesthetics as being the sole or primary cause of this distribution.

==== The EDAR locus ====
A group of studies have recently shown that genetic patterns at the EDAR locus, a region of the modern human genome that contributes to hair texture variation among most individuals of East Asian descent, support the hypothesis that (East Asian) straight hair likely developed in this branch of the modern human lineage subsequent to the original expression of tightly coiled [[natural afro-hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18065779|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=835–43|issue=6|volume=17|last2=Kimura|first2=R|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|last3=Ohashi|first3=J|last4=Omi|first4=K|last5=Yuliwulandari|first5=R|last6=Batubara|first6=L|last7=Mustofa|first7=MS|last8=Samakkarn|first8=U|last9=Settheetham-Ishida|first9=W|last10=Ishida|first10=T.|last11=Morishita|first11=Y.|last12=Furusawa|first12=T.|last13=Nakazawa|first13=M.|last14=Ohtsuka|first14=R.|last15=Tokunaga|first15=K.|title=A scan for genetic determinants of human hair morphology: EDAR is associated with Asian hair thickness|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/6/835.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm355|display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18704500|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=179–85|issue=2|volume=124|last2=Ohashi|first2=J|journal=Human Genetics|last3=Nishida|first3=N|last4=Miyagawa|first4=T|last5=Morishita|first5=Y|last6=Tsunoda|first6=T|last7=Kimura|first7=R|last8=Tokunaga|first8=K|title=A replication study confirmed the EDAR gene to be a major contributor to population differentiation regarding head hair thickness in Asia|url=http://www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2241/103672/1/HG_124-2.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00439-008-0537-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mou|first1=C|last2=Thomason|first2=HA|last3=Willan|first3=PM|last4=Clowes|first4=C|last5=Harris|first5=WE|last6=Drew|first6=CF|last7=Dixon|first7=J|last8=Dixon|first8=MJ|last9=Headon|first9=DJ|title=Enhanced ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) signaling alters multiple fiber characteristics to produce the East Asian hair form|journal=Human Mutation|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1405–11|year=2008|pmid=18561327|doi=10.1002/humu.20795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the relevant findings indicate that the EDAR mutation coding for the predominant East Asian 'coarse' or thick, straight hair texture arose within the past ~65,000 years, which is a time frame that covers from the earliest of the 'Out of Africa' migrations up to now.

==Disease==
{{See also|Hair diseases|}}
[[Tinea corporis|Ringworm]] is a [[mycosis|fungal disease]] that targets hairy skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dermatologyinfo.net/english/chapters/chapter10.htm |title=Dermatologyinfo.net |publisher=Dermatologyinfo.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Premature greying of hair]] is another condition that results in greying before the age of 20 years in Whites, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=5;spage=641;epage=653;aulast=Pandhi#ref4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal practices==
[[Depilation]] is the removal of hair from the surface of the skin. This can be achieved through methods such as [[shaving]]. [[Epilation]] is the removal of the entire hair strand, including the part of the hair that has not yet left the follicle. A popular way to epilate hair is through [[waxing]].

===Shaving===
[[File:Shaving-system-2blade.jpg|thumb|Many razors have multiple blades purportedly to ensure a close shave. While shaving initially will leave skin feeling smooth and hair free, new hair growth can appear a few hours after hair removal.]]
[[Shaving]] is accomplished with bladed instruments, such as [[razors]]. The [[blade]] is brought close to the skin and stroked over the hair in the desired area to cut the terminal hairs and leave the skin feeling smooth. Depending upon the rate of growth, one can begin to feel the hair growing back within hours of shaving. This is especially evident in men who develop a [[five o'clock shadow]] after having shaved their faces. This new growth is called [[Shaving|stubble]]. Stubble typically appears to grow back thicker because the shaved hairs are blunted instead of tapered off at the end, although the hair never actually grows back thicker.

===Waxing===
[[Waxing]] involves using a sticky wax and strip of paper or cloth to pull hair from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique to keep an area hair-free for long periods of time. It can take three to six weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have previously been waxed also is known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.

===Laser removal===
{{main|Laser hair removal}}

Laser hair removal is a cosmetic method where a small [[laser]] beam pulses selective heat on dark target matter in the area that causes hair growth without harming the skin tissue.  This process is repeated several times over the course of many months to a couple of years with hair regrowing less frequently until it finally stops; this is used as a more permanent solution to [[waxing]] or [[shaving]].  Laser removal is practiced in many clinics along with many at-home products.

===Cutting and trimming===
{{see also|Ponytail}}

Because the hair on the head is normally longer than other types of body hair, it is cut with [[scissors]] or [[Manual hair clippers|clippers]]. People with longer hair will most often use scissors to cut their hair, whereas shorter hair is maintained using a trimmer. Depending on the desired length and overall health of the hair, periods without cutting or trimming the hair can vary.

Cut hair may be used in [[wig]]s. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Ankush|title=Human Hair &quot;Waste&quot; and Its Utilization: Gaps and Possibilities|journal=Journal of Waste Management|date=27 April 2014|doi=10.1155/2014/498018|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jwm/2014/498018/|accessdate=3 December 2015|volume=2014|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include the [[face]], [[ear]]s, [[human head|head]], eyebrows, [[human leg|leg]]s, and [[armpit]]s, as well as the [[pubic region]]. The highly visible differences between male and female body and facial hair are a notable [[secondary sex characteristic]].

The world's longest documented hair belongs to Xie Qiuping (China), at 5.627 m (18&amp;nbsp;ft 5.54 in) when measured on 8 May 2004. She has been growing her hair since 1973, from the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2011|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=9781904994572|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indication of status===
Healthy hair indicates health and  youth (important in [[evolutionary biology]]). Hair color and texture can be a sign of ethnic ancestry. [[Facial hair]] is a sign of [[puberty]] in men. White hair is a sign of age or genetics, which may be concealed with [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] (not easily for some), although many prefer to assume it (especially if it is a [[poliosis]] characteristic of the person since childhood). Male pattern [[baldness]] is a sign of age, which may be concealed with a [[toupee]], hats, or religious and cultural adornments. Although drugs and medical procedures exist for the treatment of baldness, many balding men simply shave their heads. In early modern China, the queue was a male hairstyle worn by the Manchus from central Manchuria and the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty; hair on the front of the head was shaved off above the temples every ten days, mimicking male-pattern baldness,  and the rest of the hair braided into a long pigtail.

[[Hairstyle]] may be an indicator of group membership. During the [[English Civil War]], the followers of [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to crop their hair close to their head, as an act of defiance to the curls and ringlets of the king's men.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p. 53. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the Parliamentary faction being nicknamed [[Roundhead]]s. Recent isotopic analysis of hair is helping to shed further light on sociocultural interaction, giving information on food procurement and consumption in the 19th century

Female art students known as the &quot;cropheads&quot; also adopted the style, notably at the Slade School in London, England. Regional variations in [[hirsutism]] cause practices regarding hair on the arms and legs to differ. Some religious groups may follow certain rules regarding hair as part of religious observance. The rules often differ for men and women.

Many subcultures have hairstyles which may indicate an unofficial membership. Many [[hippie]]s, [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] and Indian [[sadhus]] have [[long hair]], as well many older [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]. Many [[punk fashion|punks]] wear a hairstyle known as a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or other spiked and dyed hairstyles; [[skinhead]]s have short-cropped or completely shaved heads. Long stylized bangs were very common for [[Emo (stereotype)|emo]]s, [[Scene (subculture)|scene kids]] and younger [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]] in the 2000s and early 2010s, among people of both [[gender]]s.

Heads were shaved in [[concentration camp]]s, and head-shaving has been used as [[punishment]], especially for women with long hair. The shaven head is common in [[military]] haircuts, while Western monks are known for the [[tonsure]]. By contrast, among some Indian holy men, the hair is worn extremely long.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In the time of Confucius (5th century BCE), the Chinese grew out their hair and often tied it, as a symbol of filial piety.

Regular hairdressing in some cultures is considered a sign of wealth or status. The [[dreadlocks]] of the [[Rastafari movement]] were despised early in the movement's history. In some cultures, having one's hair cut can symbolize a liberation from one's past, usually after a trying time in one's life. Cutting the hair also may be a sign of mourning.

Tightly coiled hair in its natural state may be worn in an [[Afro]]. This hairstyle was once worn among [[African American]]s as a symbol of racial pride. Given that the coiled texture is the natural state of some African Americans' hair, or perceived as being more &quot;African&quot;, this simple style is now often seen as a sign of self-acceptance and an affirmation that the beauty norms of the ([[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]]) dominant culture are not absolute. It is important to note that African Americans as a whole have a variety of hair textures, as they are not an ethnically homogeneous group, but an ad-hoc of different racial admixtures.

The film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) includes the assumption that the two main characters could have their long hairs forcibly shaved with a rusty razor when jailed, symbolizing the intolerance of some conservative groups toward members of the [[counterculture]]. At the conclusion of the [[Oz trial|Oz obscenity trials in the UK in 1971]], the defendants had their heads shaved by the police, causing public outcry. During the appeal trial, they appeared in the dock wearing wigs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathon Green|Green, Jonathon]], (1999). ''All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counterculture''.

===Religious practices===
Women's hair may be hidden using [[headscarf|headscarves]], a common part of the ''[[hijab]]'' in [[Islam]] and a symbol of modesty required for certain religious rituals in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. [[Russian Orthodox Church]] requires all married women to wear headscarves inside the church; this tradition is often extended to all women, regardless of marital status. [[Orthodox Judaism]] also commands the use of scarves and other head coverings for married women for modesty reasons. Certain [[Hindu]] sects also wear head scarves for religious reasons. [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] have an obligation not to cut hair (a Sikh cutting hair becomes 'apostate' which means fallen from religion)&lt;ref&gt;Dilgeer, Harjinder Singh (2005) ''Dictionary of Sikh Philosophy'', Sikh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and men keep it tied in a bun on the head, which is then covered appropriately using a [[turban]]. Multiple religions, both ancient and contemporary, require or advise one to allow their hair to become [[dreadlocks]], though people also wear them for fashion. For men, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and other religious groups have at various times recommended or required the covering of the head and sections of the hair of men, and some have dictates relating to the cutting of men's facial and head hair. Some Christian sects throughout history and up to modern times have also religiously proscribed the cutting of women's hair. For some [[Sunni]] [[madhab]]s, the donning of a [[Kufi]] or [[Topi (cap)]] is a form of [[sunnah]].&lt;ref&gt;The War Within Our Hearts – Page 65 Sa'ad Quadri – 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hawker Siddeley Harrier''', developed in the 1960s, was the first of the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] series of aircraft. It was the first operational [[ground attack aircraft|close-support]] and [[reconnaissance]] [[fighter aircraft]] with [[vertical/short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|Hawker Siddeley Kestrel]] prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154]]. The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), in the 1970s.

During the Harrier's service the RAF positioned the bulk of the aircraft in [[West Germany]] to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the [[Warsaw Pact]] forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for [[close air support]], operating from [[amphibious assault ship]]s, and, if needed, [[forward operating base]]s. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.

In the 1970s the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]] was developed from the Harrier for use by the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) on {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier}}s. The Sea Harrier and the Harrier fought in the 1982 [[Falklands War]], in which the aircraft proved to be crucial and versatile. The RN Sea Harriers provided fixed-wing air defence while the RAF Harriers focused on ground-attack missions in support of the advancing British land force. The Harrier was also extensively redesigned as the [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier II]] and [[British Aerospace Harrier II]] by the team of [[McDonnell Douglas]] and [[British Aerospace]]. The innovative Harrier family and its [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus]] engines with [[thrust vectoring]] nozzles have generated long-term interest in V/STOL aircraft. Similar V/STOL operational aircraft include the contemporary Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-38]]. The F-35B V/STOL variant of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] is under development.

==Development==

===Origins===
{{Main|Hawker Siddeley P.1127}}
&lt;!-- This section is a summary. Please add new material to the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]] article. --&gt;

The Harrier's design was derived from the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|Hawker P.1127]]. Prior to developing the P.1127 [[Hawker Aircraft]] had been working on a replacement for the [[Hawker Hunter]], the [[Hawker P.1121]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Thornborough 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The P.1121 was cancelled after the release of the British Government's [[1957 Defence White Paper]], which advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. This policy resulted in the termination of the majority of aircraft development projects then underway for the British military.&lt;ref name= Jefford_11&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawker sought to quickly move on to a new project and became interested in Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which did not need runways.{{refn|The development of a V/STOL jet was not Hawker's primary objective as it had put in a joint bid with [[Avro]] to meet the GOR.339 Requirement (which resulted in the [[BAC TSR-2]] development programme), but had been unsuccessful. The inability to obtain work on conventional aircraft in a hostile political climate was perhaps the greatest motivation for Hawker to proceed with the development of the Harrier.&lt;ref name= Jefford_25&gt;Jefford 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} According to Air Chief Marshal [[Patrick Hine|Sir Patrick Hine]] this interest may have been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref name= &quot;Jefford_11–12&quot;&gt;Jefford 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design work on the P.1127 was formally started in 1957 by Sir [[Sydney Camm]], [[Ralph Hooper]] of Hawker Aircraft, and [[Stanley Hooker]] (later Sir Stanley Hooker) of the [[Bristol Engine Company]].&lt;ref name= Jefford_26-27&gt;Jefford 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The close cooperation between Hawker, the airframe company, and Bristol, the engine company, was viewed by project engineer [[Gordon Lewis (engineer)|Gordon Lewis]] as one of the key factors that allowed the development of the Harrier to continue in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.&lt;ref name= Jefford_23&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using rotors or a direct jet thrust, the P.1127 had an innovative [[thrust vectoring|vectored thrust]] [[turbofan engine]], the [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]]. The Pegasus I was rated at {{convert|9000|lb(f)|kN|sigfig=2}} of thrust and first ran in September 1959.&lt;ref name= Jefford_24&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A contract for two development prototypes was signed in June 1960 and the first flight followed in October 1960.&lt;ref name= Jefford_24/&gt; Of the six prototypes built three crashed—including one during an air display at the 1963 [[Paris Air Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason 91 p413-6&quot;&gt;Mason 1991, pp. 413–416.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripartite evaluation===
[[File:Hawker Siddeley XV-6A Kestrel USAF.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley XV-6A Kestrel in later USAF markings|alt=An aircraft landed on a runway]]

In 1961 the United Kingdom, United States and [[West Germany]] jointly agreed to purchase nine aircraft developed from the P.1127, for the evaluation of the performance and potential of V/STOL aircraft. These aircraft were built by [[Hawker Siddeley]] and were [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] ''Kestrel FGA.1'' by the UK.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kestrel was strictly an evaluation aircraft and to save money the Pegasus 5 engine was not fully developed as intended, only having {{convert|15000|lb(f)|kN|sigfig=2}} of thrust instead of the projected {{convert|18200|lb(f)|kN|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39/&gt; The Tripartite Evaluation Squadron numbered ten pilots; four each from the UK and US and two from West Germany.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39/&gt; The Kestrel's first flight took place on 7 March 1964.&lt;ref name= Jefford_41&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 960 sorties had been made during the trials, including 1,366 takeoffs and landings, by the end of evaluations in November 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Spick 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Jefford_47&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation ''XV-6A Kestrel'', and underwent further testing.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, A. &quot;American Harrier – Part One.&quot; ''Model Aircraft Monthly'', Vol. 8, Issue 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Kenneth J. and Charles R.

===P.1154===
{{main|Hawker Siddeley P.1154}}

At the time of the development of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a [[supersonic]] version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft.&lt;ref name= Jefford_12&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; The design used a single [[Bristol Siddeley BS100]] engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of [[afterburner|plenum chamber burning]] (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds.&lt;ref name= 'buttler 119-120'&gt;Buttler 2000, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as [[Dassault Aviation]]'s [[Dassault Mirage IIIV|Mirage IIIV]]. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.&lt;ref name= Jefford_12-13&gt;Jefford 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Mirage IIIV had been rejected mainly because of its excessive complexity, using nine engines compared with the P.1154's single engine approach.&lt;ref name= Jefford_19&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy planned to develop and introduce the supersonic P.1154 independently of the cancelled NATO requirement. This ambition was complicated by the conflicting requirements between the two services—while the RAF wanted a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, the Navy sought a twin-engine [[air defence]] fighter.&lt;ref name= Jefford_13&gt;Jefford 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election of the Labour Government of 1964 the P.1154 was cancelled, as the Royal Navy had already begun procurement of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas Phantom II]] and the RAF placed a greater importance on the [[BAC TSR-2]]'s ongoing development.&lt;ref name= Jefford_13/&gt; Work continued on elements of the project, such as a supersonic PCB-equipped Pegasus engine, with the intention of developing a future Harrier variant for the decades following cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;Moxton 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;1633.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The supersonic Harrier is not to be confused with the Big Wing Harrier. Neither concept would result in a successor aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Moxton 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;1635.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

===Production===
Following the collapse of the P.1154's development the RAF began considering a simple upgrade of the existing subsonic Kestrel and issued Requirement ASR 384 for a V/STOL ground attack jet.&lt;ref name= Jefford_13/&gt; Hawker Siddeley received an order for six pre-production aircraft in 1965, designated ''P.1127 (RAF)'', of which the first made its maiden flight on 31 August 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason harrier p78&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt; An order for 60 production aircraft, designated as Harrier GR.1, was received in early 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason harrier p81&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%201559.html &quot;VTOL Aircraft 1966&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 26 May 1966. p.&amp;nbsp;884. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aircraft was named for the [[Harrier (bird)|Harrier]], a small bird of prey.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Harrier GR.1 made its first flight on 28 December 1967. It officially entered service with the RAF on 18 April 1969 when the Harrier Conversion Unit at [[RAF Wittering]] received its first aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans p21-22&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft were built in two factories—one in [[Kingston upon Thames]], southwest London, and the other at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_66&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Flight deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski-jump]] technique for launching Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] from 1977. Following these tests ski-jumps were added to the flight decks of all RN carriers from 1979 onwards, in preparation for the new variant for the navy, the Sea Harrier.&lt;ref&gt;Vann 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s the British and American governments held talks on producing Harriers in the United States. Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas formed a partnership in 1969 in preparation for American production,&lt;ref name= Nordeen_28&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; but Congressman [[Mendel Rivers]] and the [[House Appropriations Committee]] held that it would be cheaper to produce the AV-8A on the pre-existing production lines in the United Kingdom—hence all AV-8A Harriers were purchased from Hawker Siddeley.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_28/&gt; Improved Harrier versions with better sensors and more powerful engines were developed in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p31,3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPJ6 p54&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= Nordeen_35/&gt;  The USMC received 102 AV-8A and 8 TAV-8A Harriers between 1971 and 1976.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_31&gt;Nordeen 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Overview===
The Harrier was typically used as a ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges.&lt;ref name= Brown_71&gt;Brown 1970, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrier is powered by a single [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]] [[turbofan]] engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight.&lt;ref name= Brown_81&gt;Brown 1970, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip.&lt;ref name= Brown_80&gt;Brown 1970, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.&lt;ref name=spick_364&gt;Spick 2000, pp. 364–371.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kestrel and the Harrier were similar in appearance, though approximately 90 per cent of the Kestrel's airframe was redesigned for the Harrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason harrier p75&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrier was powered by the more powerful Pegasus 6 engine; new air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors were added to produce the required airflow at low speed. Its wing was modified to increase area and the landing gear was strengthened. Several [[hardpoint]]s were installed, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage; two {{convert|30|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[ADEN cannon]] [[gun pod]]s could also be fitted to the underside of the fuselage. The Harrier was outfitted with updated avionics to replace the basic systems used in the Kestrel;{{refn|Some avionics systems used in the Harrier had been carried over from the cancelled [[BAC TSR-2]], such as the Weapon Aiming Computer.&lt;ref name= 'Jefford 48'&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} a navigational-attack system incorporating an [[inertial navigation system]], originally for the P.1154, was installed and information was presented to the pilot by a [[head-up display]] and a moving map display.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason Harrier p73-6&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, pp. 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p14,6&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 14, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrier's VTOL abilities allowed it to be deployed from very small prepared clearings or helipads as well as normal airfields.{{refn|The area needed for a Harrier to comfortably take off was said to be less than a tennis court, while the majority of aircraft required a two-mile-long runway.&lt;ref name= Brown_82&gt;Brown 1970, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} It was believed that, in a high-intensity conflict, air bases would be vulnerable and likely to be quickly knocked out.{{refn|Experience from the Second World War had made this vulnerability abundantly clear to many Air Force officers around the world; this perception of vulnerability contributed heavily to the interest in and development of VTOL aircraft like the Harrier.&lt;ref name= Jefford_9&gt;Jefford 2005, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The capability to scatter Harrier squadrons to dozens of small &quot;alert pads&quot; on the front lines was highly prized by military strategists and the USMC procured the aircraft because of this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1970, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Some officers went so far as to deride conventional aircraft, unfavourably comparing to the [[Maginot Line]], as static and highly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.W.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I still don't believe the Harrier. Think of the millions that have been spent on VTO in America and Russia, and quite a bit in Europe, and yet the only vertical take-off aircraft which you can call a success is the Harrier.

The Harrier, while serving for many decades in various forms, has been criticised on multiple issues; in particular a [[List of Harrier Jump Jet family losses|high accident rate]], though Nordeen notes that several conventional single-engine strike aircraft like the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] had worse accident rates.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_155&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in 2003 that the Harrier &quot;...has amassed the highest major accident rate of any military plane now in service.

Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Lee Buland of the USMC declared the maintenance of a Harrier to be a &quot;challenge&quot;; the need to remove the wings before performing most work upon the engine, including engine replacements, meant the Harrier required considerable man-hours in maintenance, more than most aircraft. Buland noted however that the maintenance difficulties were unavoidable in order to create a V/STOL aircraft.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_118&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine===
{{main|Rolls-Royce Pegasus}}
[[File:Aircraft engine RR Pegasus cut-out RH.jpg|thumb|Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine on display, sections have been cut out to provide an internal view|alt=Aircraft engine, partially uncovered as an exhibit]]

The Pegasus turbofan jet engine, developed in tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. [[Bristol Siddeley]] developed it from their earlier conventional [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus|Orpheus]] turbofan engine as the core with [[Bristol Olympus|Olympus]] compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles.&lt;ref&gt;Gunston, W. T. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%201299.html &quot;Bristol Siddeley's Fans&quot;.] ''Flight'', 12 August 1960, pp. 210–211. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load.&lt;ref name= 'flight pegasus 190'/&gt; The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team.&lt;ref name= Jefford_27&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_118/&gt;

The aircraft was initially powered by the Pegasus 6 engine which was replaced by the more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process.&lt;ref name= 'flight pegasus 189'/&gt; The primary focus throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible,&lt;ref name= 'flight pegasus 189'&gt;Gunston 1977, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; tempered by the amount of funding that was available.&lt;ref name= Jefford_39/&gt; Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life;&lt;ref name= 'flight pegasus 190'&gt;Gunston 1977, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements.&lt;ref name= 'flight pegasus 189'/&gt; Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 ([[Mark (designation)|Mk]] 107), which provides 23,800&amp;nbsp;lbf (106&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRpeg408&quot;&gt;[http://www.rolls-royce.com/Images/pegasus_tcm92-6700.pdf &quot;Pegasus – Power for the Harrier.&quot;] ''Rolls-Royce,'' 2004.

===Controls and handling===

[[File:Pegasus-engine-diagram.svg|thumb|alt=Nozzle locations|Locations of the four nozzles on the aircraft]]

The Harrier has been described by pilots as &quot;unforgiving&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft is capable of both forward flight (where it behaves in the manner of a typical fixed-wing aircraft above its [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed), as well as [[VTOL]] and [[STOL]] manoeuvres (where the traditional [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[Flight control surfaces|control surfaces]] are useless) requiring skills and technical knowledge usually associated with helicopters. Most services demand great aptitude and extensive training for Harrier pilots, as well as experience in piloting both types of aircraft. Trainee pilots are often drawn from highly experienced and skilled helicopter pilots.{{refn|In preparation for flying the Kestrel, pilots of the Tripartite Evaluation Squadron were provided with several hours of helicopter piloting tuition, all of whom agreed on the effort being highly worthwhile preparation.&lt;ref name= Jefford_41/&gt;|group=N}}&lt;ref name= Jefford_41/&gt;

In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit.&lt;ref name= Jefford_42&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Markman and Holder 2000, pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_25&gt;Jenkins 1998, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrier has two control elements not found in conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the [[reaction control system]]. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the [[Helicopter flight controls#Cyclic|cyclic control]] of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.&lt;ref name= Jefford_36&gt;Jefford 2006, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind direction is a critical factor in VTOL manoeuvres. The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The thrust vector is set to 90° and the throttle is brought up to maximum, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is trimmed until a hover state is achieved at the desired altitude.&lt;ref name= Brown_83/&gt;  The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with normal takeoff and then applying a thrust vector (less than 90°) at a runway speed below normal takeoff speed; usually the point of application is around {{convert|65|kn|km/h}}. For lower takeoff speeds the thrust vector is greater.&lt;ref name= Jefford_42/&gt; The reaction control system involves a thrusters at key points in the aircraft's fuselage and nose, also the wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control and correct the aircraft's pitch and roll during vertical flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/control/TH28G9.htm &quot;Hawker Harrier reaction control system&quot;] ''U.S. Centennial of Flight'', 2003. Retrieved 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotating the vectored thrust nozzles into a forward-facing position during normal flight is called [[vectoring in forward flight]], or &quot;VIFFing&quot;. This is a [[dog fight|dog-fighting]] tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking could cause a chasing aircraft to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier it was chasing, a combat technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_33-4&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spick_382&gt;Spick 2000, pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between versions===
The two largest users of the Harrier were the Royal Air Force and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The exported model of the aircraft operated by the USMC was designated the AV-8A Harrier, which was broadly similar to the RAF's Harrier GR.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p43&quot;/&gt; Changes included the removal of all magnesium components, which corroded quickly at sea, and the integration of American radios and [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) systems; furthermore the outer pylons, unlike the RAF aircraft, were designed from delivery to be equipped with self-defence [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] heat-seeking air-to-air missiles.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_31/&gt; Most of the AV-8As had been delivered with the more powerful Pegasus engine used in the GR.3 instead of the one used in the earlier GR.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p43&quot;/&gt; Two-seat Harriers were operated for training purposes; the body was stretched and a taller tail fin added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p27-8&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF trained in the T.2 and T.4 versions, while T.4N and T.8 were training versions the Navy's Sea Harrier, with appropriate fittings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p67-8&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 67–68, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The US and Spain flew the TAV-8A and TAV-8S, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p50&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Nordeen_14&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

All RAF GR.1s and the initial AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 inertial navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The [[Martin-Baker]] ejection seats were also replaced by the [[Stencel SEU-3A]] in the American aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason Harrier p115-9&quot;&gt;Mason 1986, pp. 115–119.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of [[electronic countermeasure]] (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p31,3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPJ6 p54&quot;/&gt; The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new [[inertial navigation]] system to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; at the same time several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_35/&gt; Spain's Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans p77-8&quot;&gt;Evans 1998, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) operated a substantially modified variant of the Harrier, the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]]. The Sea Harrier was not intended for ground-attack duties and, unlike the standard Harrier, was equipped with [[radar]] and Sidewinder missiles for air combat duties and [[air defence|fleet air defence]].{{refn|While the USMC Harriers had Sidewinder missiles, they still lacked radars.|group=N}} The Sea Harrier was also fitted with navigational aids for carrier landings, modifications to reduce corrosion and a raised bubble-canopy for greater visibility.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bull 120&quot;&gt;Bull 2004, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p51&gt;Jenkins 1998, pp. 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft were later equipped to use [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond-visual-range]] anti-aircraft missiles and the more advanced Blue Vixen radar for longer range air-to-air combat, as well as [[Sea Eagle missile]]s for conducting anti-ship missions.&lt;ref name= &quot;New Science Harrier 2&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BX7c6gVuyVQC&amp;pg=PA780&amp;dq=Sea+Harrier&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lNkfTJ2BDs6TOMXCya0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Sea%20Harrier&amp;f=false &quot;Navy puts more punch in its Harriers&quot;.] ''New Scientist'', 98(1362), 16 June 1983, p. 780. Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II]] is the latest Harrier variant, a second-generation series to replace the first generation of Harrier jets already in service; all the above variants of the Harrier have mainly been retired with the Harrier II taking their place in the RAF, USMC and FAA. In the 1970s the United Kingdom considered two options for replacing their existing Harriers: joining [[McDonnell Douglas]] (MDD) in developing the [[BAE Harrier II]], or the independent development of a &quot;Big Wing&quot; Harrier. This proposal would have increased the wing area from {{convert|200|to|250|ft2|m2|sigfig=2}}, allowing for significant increases in weapons load and internal fuel reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Jefford 2006, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The option of cooperation with MDD was chosen in 1982 over the more risky isolated approach.&lt;ref&gt;Nordeen 2006, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace explored the Skyhook, a new technique to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h9QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=en&amp;ei=KvMNTuKJCoWj8QPH0OStDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Skyhooks for Harriers&quot;.] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1983, p. 181.

The first generation of Harriers did not see further combat with the RAF after the Falklands War, although they continued to serve for years afterwards. As a deterrent against further Argentine invasion attempts, [[No. 1453 Flight RAF]] was deployed to the [[Falkland Islands]] from August 1983 to June 1985.&lt;ref name=Sturtivant123&gt;Sturtivant 2007, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; However the second generation [[British Aerospace Harrier II|Harrier II]]s saw action in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]] promoted the concept of a [[Sea Control Ship]], a 15,000-ton light carrier equipped with Harriers and helicopters, to supplement the larger aircraft carriers of the [[US Navy]]. An amphibious assault ship, {{USS|Guam|LPH-9|6}}, was converted into the ''Interim Sea Control Ship'' and operated as such between 1971 and 1973 with the purpose of studying the limits and possible obstacles for operating such a vessel.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_33&gt;Nordeen 2006, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baitis, A.

Other exercises were performed to demonstrate the AV-8A's suitability for operating from various amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers, including a deployment of 14 Harriers aboard {{USS|Franklin D. Roosevelt|CV-42|6}} for six months in 1976.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_33/&gt; The tests showed, amongst other things, that the Harrier was capable of performing in weather where conventional carrier aircraft could not.&lt;ref name= Nordeen_33/&gt; In support of naval operations, the USMC devised and studied several methods to further integrate the Harrier. One result was ''Arapaho'', a stand-by system to rapidly convert civilian cargo ships into seagoing platforms for operating and maintaining a handful of Harriers, to be used to augment the number of available ships to deploy upon.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Miller 1986, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Arapaho would have been operationally similar to the British container ship {{SS|Atlantic Conveyor||2}}, which not only transported Harriers but was modified to enable crude flight operations as well.|group=N}}

When the reactivation of the {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s was under consideration, a radical design for a battleship-carrier hybrid emerged that would have replaced the ship's rear turret with a flight deck, complete with a hangar and two ski jumps, for operating several Harriers. However, the USMC considered the need for [[naval gunfire support]] to be a greater priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay associated with such elaborate conversions was significant, and the concept was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Burr and Bull 2010, pp. 37–38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hybrid p159-163&quot;&gt;Layman and McLaughlin 1991, pp. 159–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marines Corps' concept for deploying the Harriers in a land-based expeditionary role focused on aggressive speed. Harrier forward bases and light maintenance facilities were to be set up in under 24 hours on any prospective battle area. The forward bases, containing one to four aircraft, were to be located {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the forward edge of battle (FEBA), while a more established permanent airbase would be located around {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the FEBA.&lt;ref name= 'bingham'/&gt;{{refn|Dispersed forward bases were heavily reliant on effective transportation to refuel and rearm the Harriers; possessing a large fleet of air transports, helicopters or ground vehicles to support such operations was identified as crucial by USMC senior officers.

The AV-8A's abilities in air-to-air combat were tested by the Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range.&lt;ref name=Nordeen_33-4/&gt; The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Congress 1979, pp. 8, 166, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliland, Woody F.

The '''Hawker Harrier''' was an experimental biplane torpedo bomber aircraft built by [[Hawker Aircraft]] to a specification issued in the 1920s  for the [[RAF]].

==Development==
In {{avyear|1925}}, the British Air Ministry laid down specifications for a high altitude bomber to replace the [[Hawker Horsley]] and for a coastal torpedo bomber ([[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1920-1929|Specifications 23/25 and 24/25]]). As these specifications were similar, the Air Ministry announced that a single competition would be held to study aircraft submitted for both specifications.&lt;ref name =&quot;mason p193&quot;&gt;Mason 1994, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sydney Camm]] of [[Hawker Aircraft]] designed the Harrier to meet the requirements of Specification 23/25, with the prototype (''J8325'') first flying in February {{avyear|1927}}, the first of the competitors for the two specifications to fly.&lt;ref name =&quot;mason p193&quot;/&gt; The Harrier was a two-seat biplane with single-bay wings powered by a geared [[Bristol Jupiter]] VIII radial engine. It was armed with one .303&amp;nbsp;in (7.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Vickers machine gun]] and one .303&amp;nbsp;in (7.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Lewis gun]] carrying a maximum of 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb (454&amp;nbsp;kg) of bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis bomber p162&quot;&gt;Lewis 1980, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype Harrier was tested at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A &amp; AEE) at [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Martlesham Heath]] in November 1927, where, while it met the requirements of Specification 23/25 and had satisfactory handling, the geared engine meant that it was underpowered,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis bomber p162&quot;/&gt; and it had an inferior bombload to the Hawker Horsley, the aircraft it was meant to replace.&lt;ref name =&quot;mason p193&quot;/&gt; It was therefore modified to carry a torpedo. On testing the modified aircraft, however, it was found to still be underpowered, being incapable of taking off with a torpedo, gunner and full fuel load.&lt;ref name =&quot;mason p193&quot;/&gt; It was therefore not considered further, the competition ultimately being won by the [[Vickers Vildebeest]].&lt;ref name =&quot;mason p200&quot;&gt;Mason 1994, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype was used by [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] as an engine testbed, flying with the 870&amp;nbsp;hp (649&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Bristol Hydra]] and the {{convert|495|hp|abbr=on}} [[Bristol Jupiter#Variants|Bristol Orion]] engines.&lt;ref name =&quot;mason p193&quot;/&gt;

'''Georges Prosper Remi''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəmi|lang}}; 22 May 1907&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1983), known by the pen name '''Hergé''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛʁʒe|}}), was a Belgian [[cartoonist]]. He is best known for creating ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the series of [[comic album]]s which are considered one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, ''[[Quick &amp; Flupke]]'' (1930–40) and ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1936–57). His works were executed in his distinct ''[[ligne claire]]'' drawing style.

Born to a lower middle-class family in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to [[Scouting]] magazines, developing his first comic series, ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'', for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]'', he created ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1929 on the advice of its editor [[Norbert Wallez]]. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], the series' early instalments – ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', and ''[[Tintin in America]]'' – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' and ''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' series for ''Le Vingtième Siècle''. Influenced by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onward. Following the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in 1940, ''Le Vingtième Siècle'' was closed but Hergé continued his series in ''[[Le Soir]]'', a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.

After the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, ''Le Soir'' was shut down and its staff – including Hergé – accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Hergé, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With [[Raymond Leblanc]] he established ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new ''Adventures of Tintin'' stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]' ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''. In 1950 he established [[Studios Hergé]] as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Bob de Moor]] greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an [[abstract art]]ist.

Hergé's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=x}}{{sfn|London Review of Books|2012}} Widely celebrated in Belgium, a [[Musée Hergé|Hergé Museum]] was established in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] in 2009.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1907–25===
[[File:Geburtshaus Hergé rue Philippe-Baucq 33.jpg|thumb|200px|The house in Etterbeek where Hergé was born]]

Georges Prosper Remi&lt;ref&gt;Opstal, H. van (1994) ''Essay RG. Het fenomeen Hergé'', pp. 8+10+132-133+195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goddin, Philippe (2008) ''Hergé. Levenslijnen'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  was born on 22 May 1907 in his parental home in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, a central suburb in the capital city of Belgium.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=6}} His was a lower middle-class family.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=11}} His [[Walloons|Walloon]] father, Alexis Remi, worked in a confectionery factory, whilst his [[Flemish people|Flemish]] mother, Elisabeth Dufour, was a housewife.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=3}} Married on 18 January 1905, they moved into a house at 25 rue Cranz (now 33 rue Philippe Baucq), where Hergé was born, although a year later they moved to a house at 34 rue de Theux.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=6}} His primary language was his father's French, but growing up in the bilingual Brussels, he also learned Dutch, developing a [[Marols|Marollien]] accent from his maternal grandmother.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=3|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=6–7}} A younger brother, Paul, was born five years after Hergé.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=11}} Like most Belgians, his family belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, though they were not particularly devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=3|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=18|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=8}} He later characterised his life in Etterbeek as dominated by a monochrome grey, considering it extremely boring.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=3–4|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=5}} Biographer [[Benoît Peeters]] suggested that this childhood melancholy might have been exacerbated through being sexually abused by a maternal uncle.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=14}}

Remi developed a love of cinema, favouring [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' and the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Harry Langdon]] and [[Buster Keaton]]; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=7|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=7}} Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'', ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', as well as the novels of Frenchman [[Alexandre Dumas]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=5|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=12–13}} Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of [[elementary education|primary schooling]] at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the [[First World War]], during which Brussels [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|was occupied by the German army]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=6|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=8}} In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in [[Ixelles]],{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=10–11}} but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=7}} Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=&quot;My childhood was extremely ordinary. It happened in a very average place, with average events and average thoughts. For me, the poet's &quot;green paradise&quot; was rather gray... My childhood, my adolescence, Boy Scouting, military service—all of it was gray. Neither a sad boyhood nor a happy one—rather a lackluster one.&quot;|source=Hergé{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=5}}}}

Aged 12, Remi joined the [[Guidisme et Scoutisme en Belgique|Boy Scout]] brigade attached to Saint-Boniface School, becoming troop leader of the Squirrel Patrol and earning the name &quot;Curious Fox&quot; (''Renard curieux'').{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=19|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=16}} With the Scouts, he travelled to summer camps in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, and in the summer of 1923 his troop hiked 200 miles across the Pyrenees.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=11–12}} His experiences with Scouting would have a significant influence on the rest of his life, sparking his love of camping and the natural world, and providing him with a [[moral compass]] that stressed personal loyalty and keeping one's promises.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=8–9}} 

His Scoutmaster, Rene Weverbergh, encouraged his artistic ability, and published one of Remi's drawings in the newsletter of the Saint-Boniface Scouts, ''Jamais Assez'' (''Never Enough''): his first published work.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}} When Weverbergh became involved in the publication of ''Boy-Scout'', the newsletter of the Federation of Scouts, he published more of Remi's illustrations, the first of which appeared in the fifth issue, from 1922.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}} Remi continued publishing cartoons, drawings and woodcuts in subsequent issues of the newsletter, which was soon renamed ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' (''The Belgian Boy Scout''). During this time, he experimented with different pseudonyms, using &quot;Jérémie&quot; and &quot;Jérémiades&quot; before settling on &quot;Hergé&quot;, the French pronunciation of his reversed initials (R.G.) His work was first published under this name in December 1924.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=20|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=19}}

===''Totor'' and early career: 1925–28===
[[File:Totor the Boy Scout.gif|right|thumb|The ''Totor'' series was Hergé's first published comic strip.]]
Alongside his stand-alone illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began production of a comic strip for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'', ''[[The Adventures of Totor|Les Aventures de Totor]]'' (''The Adventures of Totor''), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including [[speech bubbles]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=22}} Illustrations were also published in ''Le Blé qui lève'' (''The Wheat That Grows'') and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, ''The Soul of the Sea''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=15|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=17}} Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived ''Atelier de la Fleur de Lys'' (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=18}}

After graduating from secondary school in 1925, Hergé enrolled in the École Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=20}} He hoped for a job as an illustrator alongside Ickx at ''[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]'' (''The Twentieth Century'')—a conservative &quot;Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information&quot;—but no positions were available. Instead he got a job in the paper's subscriptions department, starting in September 1925.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=11|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=20}} Despising the boredom of this position, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in August 1926 was assigned to the Dailly barracks at [[Schaerbeek]]. Joining the first infantry regiment, he was also bored by his military training, but continued sketching and producing episodes of ''Totor''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=11|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=21–23}}

Toward the end of his military service, in August 1927, Hergé met the editor of ''Le Vingtième Siècle'', the Abbé [[Norbert Wallez]], a vocal fascist who kept a signed photograph of the Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] on his desk.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=11–13|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=27}} Impressed by Hergé's repertoire, Wallez agreed to give him a job as a photographic reporter and cartoonist for the paper, something for which Hergé always remained grateful, coming to view the Abbé as a father figure.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=12, 14–15|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=27–28}} Supplemented by commissions for other publications, Hergé illustrated a number of texts for &quot;The Children's Corner&quot; and the literary pages; the illustrations of this period show his interest in woodcuts and the early prototype of his ''ligne claire'' style.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=15–16|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=28–29}}

===Founding ''Tintin'' and ''Quick &amp; Flupke'': 1929–32===
Beginning a series of newspaper supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, ''[[Le Petit Vingtième]]'' (''The Little Twentieth''), which subsequently appeared in ''Le Vingtième Siècle'' every Thursday.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=31–32}} Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=38}} For this new venture, Hergé illustrated ''L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet'' (''The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet''), a comic strip authored by one of the paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=16|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=12|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=32}} Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as [[George McManus]]' ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and [[Rudolph Dirks]]'s ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'', copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter [[Léon Degrelle]], stationed there to report on the [[Cristero War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=17|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=18|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=18}}

[[File:Le Petit Vingtieme, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.jpg|thumb|left|The front page of the edition of 1 May 1930 of {{lang|fr|''Le Petit Vingtième''}}, declaring &quot;{{lang|fr|''Tintin Revient!''}}&quot; (&quot;Tintin Returns!&quot;) from his adventure in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=67}}]]

Hergé developed a character named [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his [[fox terrier]], [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]]—&quot;Milou&quot; in the original French—basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=25|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=34}} Degrelle later falsely claimed that Tintin had been based on him, while he and Hergé fell out when Degrelle used one of his designs without permission; they settled out-of-court.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=45–46|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=59–60}} Although Hergé wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the [[Soviet Union]], acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', began serialisation in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' on 10 January 1929, and ran until 8 May 1930.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=22–23|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=34–37}} Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=39–41}} The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants, Eugène Van Nyverseel and Paul &quot;Jam&quot; Jamin.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=32–34|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=42–43}}

In January 1930, Hergé introduced ''[[Quick &amp; Flupke]]'' (''Quick et Flupke''), a new comic strip about two street kids from Brussels, in the pages of ''Le Petit Vingtième''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=95|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=23–24|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=44–45}} At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the [[Belgian Congo]]. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, at the time it was un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=26–29|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=45–47}} For the third adventure, ''[[Tintin in America]]'', serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, although he used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultra-conservative ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=46–50|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=30–32}} Although the ''Adventures of Tintin'' had been serialised in the French Catholic ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]'' (&quot;Brave Hearts&quot;) since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=35}} Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed &quot;conservative young man&quot; dedicated to his work.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=44|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=43, 48}}

Hergé sought work elsewhere too, creating ''[[Minor comics by Hergé#The Amiable Mr. Mops|The Lovable Mr. Mops]]'' cartoon for the [[Bon Marché]] department store,{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=49|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=25}} and ''[[Minor comics by Hergé#The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel out West|The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West]]'' for the rival L'Innovation department store.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=46|2a1=Goddin|2y=2008|2p=89}} On 20 July 1932 he married [[Germaine Kieckens]], who was Wallez's secretary; although neither of them were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged to do so by Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in [[Laeken]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=33–34|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=47–48}} Spending their honeymoon in [[Vianden]], [[Luxembourg]], the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, [[Schaerbeek]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=58}} After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of ''Le Petit Vingtième''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=40–41|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=60, 67–68}}

===''Tintin in the Orient'' and ''Jo, Zette &amp; Jocko'': 1932–39===
In November 1932 Hergé announced that the following month he would send Tintin on an adventure to Asia.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=62}}  Although initially titled ''The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient'', it would later be renamed ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''. A mystery story, the plot began in Egypt before proceeding to Arabia and India, during which the recurring characters of [[Thomson and Thompson]] and [[Rastapopoulos]] were introduced.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=52–57|2a1 = Assouline|2y = 2009|2pp =42–44|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=62–65}} Through his friend Charles Lesne, Hergé was hired to produce illustrations for the company [[Casterman]], and in late 1933 they proposed taking over the publication of both ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and ''Quick and Flupke'' in book form, to which Hergé agreed; the first Casterman book was the collected volume of ''Cigars''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=40–41, 44|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=57, 60}} Continuing to subsidise his comic work with commercial advertising, in January 1934 he also founded the &quot;Atelier Hergé&quot; advertising company with two partners, but it was liquidated after six months.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=49|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=36–37|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=60–61}} From February to August 1934 Hergé serialised ''[[Popol Out West]]'' in ''Le Petit Vingtième'', a story using animal characters that was a development of the earlier ''Tim the Squirrel'' comic.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=73}}

From August 1934 to October 1935, ''Le Petit Vingtième'' serialised Tintin's next adventure, ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', which was set in China and dealt with the recent [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. Hergé had been greatly influenced in the production of the work by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], a Catholic Chinese student studying at Brussels' [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]], to whom he had been introduced in May 1934. Zhang gave him lessons in Taoist philosophy, Chinese art and Chinese calligraphy, influencing not only his artistic style but also his general outlook on life.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=60–64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51–59|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=33–36|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=48–55|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=73–82}} As a token of appreciation Hergé added a fictional &quot;[[Chang Chong-Chen]]&quot; to ''The Blue Lotus'', a young Chinese boy who meets and befriends Tintin.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=60–64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51–59|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=33–36|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=48–55|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=73–82}} For ''The Blue Lotus'', Hergé devoted far more attention to accuracy, resulting in a largely realistic portrayal of China.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=60–64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51–59|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=33–36|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=48–55|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=73–82}} As a result, ''The Blue Lotus'' has been widely hailed as &quot;Hergé's first masterpiece&quot; and a benchmark in the series' development.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=82}} Casterman published it in book form, also insisting that Hergé include colour plates in both the volume and in reprints of ''America'' and ''Cigars''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1pp=182, 196|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=53|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=79–80}} In 1936, they also began production of Tintin merchandise, something Hergé supported, having ideas of an entire shop devoted to ''The Adventures of Tintin'', something that would come to fruition 50 years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=55|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=96}} Nevertheless, while his serialised comics proved lucrative, the collected volumes sold less well, something Hergé blamed on Casterman, urging them to do more to market his books.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=94}}

[[File:Jo Zette Jocko in Coeurs Vaillants.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' in ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]'']]
Hergé's next Tintin story, ''[[The Broken Ear]]'' (1935–37), was the first for which the plot synopsis had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of [[General Alcazar]], and also saw Hergé introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on Bolivia and Paraguay.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=68–73|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=61–69|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=37–39|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=55–57|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=82–84}}
The violent elements within ''The Broken Ear'' upset the publishers of ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]'', who asked Hergé to create a more child-appropriate story for them. The result was ''The Adventures of Jo, Zette, and Jocko'', a series about a young brother and sister and their pet monkey.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=86–87}} The series began with ''The Secret Ray'', which was serialised in ''Cœurs Vaillants'' and then ''Le Petit Vingtième'', and continued with ''The Stratoship H-22''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=87}} Hergé nevertheless disliked the series, commenting that the characters &quot;bored me terribly.&quot;{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=88}} Now writing three series simultaneously, Hergé was working every day of the year, and felt stressed.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=91}}

The next Tintin adventure was ''[[The Black Island]]'' (1937–38), which saw the character travel to Britain to battle counterfeiters and introduced a new antagonist, the German Dr. Müller.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=76–80|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=71–78|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=39–42|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=58–59|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5p=91}} Hergé followed this with ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' (1938–39), in which Tintin saves the fictional Eastern European country of Syldavia from being invaded by its expansionist neighbour, Borduria; the event was an anti-fascist satire of [[Nazi Germany]]'s expansion into Austria and Czechoslovakia.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=82–86|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=81–89|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=42–44|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=61–63|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=97–101}} In May 1939, Hergé moved to a new house in [[Watermael-Boitsfort]],{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=102}} although following the German [[invasion of Poland]], he was conscripted into the Belgian army and temporarily stationed in [[Herenthout]]. Demobbed within the month, he returned to Brussels and adopted a more explicit anti-German stance when beginning his next Tintin adventure, ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', which was set in the Middle East and featured Dr. Müller sabotaging oil lines.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=63|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=102–103}}

During this period, Hergé also contributed to ''L'Ouest'' (''The West''), a newspaper run by his friend [[Raymond De Becker]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=103–4}} ''L'Ouest'' urged Belgium to remain neutral in [[World War II]], a stance Hergé supported, creating the ''Mr Bellum'' strip to argue this position.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=64–65|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=103–104}} Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who had enjoyed ''The Blue Lotus'', although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=63–64|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=105–106}} He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in [[Antwerp]], from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to ''Le Petit Vingtième''. However, he fell ill with [[sinusitis]] and [[boils]] and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, [[Battle of Belgium|Germany invaded Belgium]]. ''Le Vingtième Siècle'' was shut down, part way through the serialisation of ''Land of Black Gold''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=63, 65|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=106–107}}

===German occupation and ''Le Soir'': 1939–45===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=&quot;It is certain that Raymond De Becker sympathized with the National Socialist system, and on this point he was in agreement with [[Henri De Man]]. I admit that I believed myself that the future of the West could depend on the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]]. For many people democracy had proven deceptive, and the New Order brought fresh hope. In Catholic circles such views were widely held. Given everything that happened, it was naturally a terrible error to have believed even for an instant in the New Order.&quot;|source=Hergé, 1973{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=117–118}} }}
As the Belgian army clashed with the invading Germans, Hergé and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in [[Paris]] and then heading south to [[Puy-de-Dôme]], where they remained for six weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=66|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=111–112}} On 28 May, Belgian King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|surrendered the country to the German army]] to prevent further killing; a move that Hergé supported. He followed the king's request that all of those Belgians who had fled the country return, arriving back in Brussels on 30 June.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=67|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=112–113}} There, he found that his house had been occupied as an office for the German army's ''[[Propagandastaffel]]'', and also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=68|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=113–114}} All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force, who refused {{lang|fr|''Le Petit Vingtième''}} permission to continue publication.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=68–69|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=114}} Instead, Hergé was offered employment as a cartoonist for {{lang|fr|''[[Le Pays Réel]]''}} by its editor, the Rexist [[Victor Matthys]]; however, Hergé perceived {{lang|fr|''Le Pays Réel''}} as an explicitly political publication, and thus declined the position.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=114–115}}

[[File:Avenue Delleur 17.JPG|thumb|Hergé's house in Avenue Delleur 17 where he lived between 1939 and 1953]]
Instead, he took up a position with {{lang|fr|''[[Le Soir]]''}}, Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted ''Le Soir'' to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=70–71|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=116–118}} After joining the ''Le Soir'' team on 15 October, Hergé was involved in the creation of a children's supplement, ''Soir-Jeunesse'', aided by Jamin and [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=72|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=120–121}} He relaunched ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with a new story, ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of [[Captain Haddock]], who would become a major character in the rest of the ''Adventures''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=124–126}} This story, like the subsequent ''Adventures of Tintin'' published in ''Le Soir'', would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=98–99|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=122}} Hergé also included new ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=73–74|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=122}}

In May 1941, a paper shortage led to the ''Soir-Jeunesse'' being reduced to four pages, with the length of the Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' being moved into ''Le Soir'' itself, where it became a daily strip.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=125}} While some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration,{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=73|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=72}} he was heavily enticed by the size of {{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}}'s readership, which reached 600,000.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=73|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|p=121}}
With Van Melkebeke, Hergé put together two Tintin plays. The first, ''Tintin in the Indies'', appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, ''Mr Boullock's Disappearance'', was performed there in December.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=109–110|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=86|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=130–131}} From October 1941 to May 1942, ''Le Soir'' serialised Hergé's next Tintin adventure, ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', followed by publication as a single volume by Casterman. In keeping with ''Le Soir'''s editorial standpoint, ''The Shooting Star'' espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=106–109|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2pp=48–51|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3pp=80–83|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4pp=130–135}}

[[File:Galerie de Traitres - Hergé.JPG|thumb|left|Booklet published by the [[Belgian Resistance|resistance]] group ''L'Insoumis'', denouncing Georges Remy {{sic}} as a collaborator. Hergé later admitted that &quot;I hated the Resistance thing... I knew that for every one of the Resistance's actions, hostages would be arrested and shot.&quot;{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=150}}]]

Casterman felt that the black-and-white volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=95|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=136–137}} For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that it would not be used for shading.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=137}}
To cope with this additional workload, Hergé approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, [[Edgar P. Jacobs]], to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=86–87|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=138–139}} Jacobs could only work on the project part time, and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=96|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=86|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=139}} In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=85|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=131}} With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous ''Adventures of Tintin'' into 62-page colour versions.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=140}}

Hergé's next ''Adventure of Tintin'' would be ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'', serialised in ''Le Soir'' from June 1942.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=52}} He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had introduced many elements from the work of [[Jules Verne]] into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=143–144}} ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'', serialised in ''Le Soir'' from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of [[Professor Calculus]] being introduced to the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1pp=52–53}} Following ''Red Rackham's Treasure'', Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled ''Dupont et Dupond, détectives'' (&quot;Thomson and Thompson, Detectives&quot;), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1pp=128, 130|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=94}}

In September 1943, De Becker was removed as editor of ''Le Soir'' for stating that although the Nazis were motivated &quot;by undoubted good will, [they were also] extremely out of touch with reality&quot;; although Hergé was close to De Becker, he decided to remain at the newspaper, which came under the editorship of Max Hodeige.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=93|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=149–150}}
In autumn 1943, Hergé had decided that he wanted Jacobs to collaborate with him on ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=98|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=152}} Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next ''Adventure of Tintin'', ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'',{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=153}} which began serialisation in ''Le Soir'' in December 1943.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=124|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=118|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=55|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=98–99}}

As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops liberated Brussels from German occupation, ''Le Soir'' ceased publication on 2 September 1944, partway through its serialisation of ''The Seven Crystal Balls''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=116}} Hergé was arrested on 3 September, having been named as a [[Collaborationism|collaborator]] in a Resistance document known as the &quot;Gallery of Traitors&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=195|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=159}} This would be the first of four incidents in which Hergé was arrested – by the State Security, the Judiciary Police, the [[Belgian National Movement]], and the [[Front de l'Indépendance|Front for Independence]] respectively – during the course of which he spent one night in jail.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=126|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=117–118|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=106|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=159}} On 5 September the entire staff of ''Le Soir'' were fired and a new editorial team introduced,{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=116}} while on 8 September the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) issued a proclamation announcing that &quot;any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession.&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=116|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=160}} Blacklisted, Hergé was now unemployed.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=106}} Further, he was publicly lampooned as a collaborator by a newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance, ''La Patrie'', which issued a satirical strip titled ''The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=127|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=118|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=106|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=160}}

The period witnessed widespread recriminations against accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=107}} A judiciary inquiry into Hergé's case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vinçotte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that &quot;I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children's book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Hergé worked for ''Le Soir'' during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper.&quot;{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=108–109}} Although unable to work for the press, Hergé continued to re-draw and colour the older ''Adventures of Tintin'' for publication in book form by Casterman, completing the second version of ''Tintin in the Congo'' and starting on ''King Ottokar's Sceptre''.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=118|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=108|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=162}} Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=162}} Attempting to circumvent his blacklisting, with Jacobs he began producing comics under the anonymous pseudonym of &quot;Olav&quot;, but upon sending them to publishers found none who would accept them.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=126|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=162}} Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life,{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=118}} he also had family problems to deal with; his brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German [[prisoner of war camp]], although their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a [[psychiatric hospital]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=163–164}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=&quot;[During the occupation] I worked, just like a miner, a tram driver or baker! But, while one found it normal for an engineer to operate a train, members of the press were labelled as 'traitors'.&quot;|source=Hergé{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=118}} }}

In October 1945, Hergé was approached by [[Raymond Leblanc]], a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the [[Mouvement National Royaliste|National Royalist Movement]], and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children, and Leblanc – who had fond childhood memories of ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'' – thought Hergé would be ideal for it.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=109|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=164–165}} Hergé agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=110}} Concerned about the judicial investigation into Hergé's wartime affiliations, Leblanc convinced William Ugeux, a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship, to look into the comic creator's file. Ugeux concluded that Hergé had been &quot;a blunderer rather than a traitor&quot; for his work at ''Le Soir''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=111–112}} The decision as to whether Hergé would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal, Walter Jean Ganshof van der Meersch. He closed the case on 22 December 1945, declaring that &quot;in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi, bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky&quot;.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=111–113}}

Now free from threat of prosecution, Hergé continued to support his colleagues at ''Le Soir'' who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=118|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=167}} Among those sentenced to death was Hergé's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=168}} In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=113|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=167}} Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=113|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=169}}
[[Harry Thompson]] has described this post-war period as the &quot;greatest upheaval&quot; of Hergé's life.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=124}} Hergé later described it as &quot;an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=113–114|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=161}} He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=161}} and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=113}}

===Establishing ''Tintin'' magazine: 1946–49===

[[File:Journal de Tintin Le Temple du Soleil.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|The first issue of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine included an image based upon ''Prisoners of the Sun''.]]

Sinave devised the idea of naming their new magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'', believing that this would attract a wide audience.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=165}} The Dutch-language edition produced for release in Belgium's Flemish north was titled ''Kuifje'' after the character's Dutch-language name.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=124|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=173}} Adopting the slogan of &quot;The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77&quot;,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=124}} the magazine also used a logo featuring the Tintin character himself.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=122}}
The [[Capital (economics)|capital]] for the project had been put up by those involved: as executive director, Leblanc provided 50%, while its managing director Georges Lallemand provided 40% and Hergé, its artistic director,  provided 10%.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=120}} Hergé assembled a group of associates to aid him, including Van Melkebeke, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier, and Jacques Laudy.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=120–121|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=171}}
Van Melkebeke was initially appointed editor-in-chief, although he was arrested for having worked for the collaborationist ''Le Nouveau journal'' shortly after, with his involvement in the project thus being kept secret so as to avoid further controversy.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=118–119|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=172, 175}} Van Melkebeke continued to provide work for the magazine under pseudonyms, although this ceased during his imprisonment from December 1947 to October 1949.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=175–176, 186}}

The first issue of ''Tintin'' magazine was published on 26 September 1946.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=120|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=173}} Hergé was assigned to produce a two-page spread each week, and began by concluding ''The Seven Crystal Balls'' before embarking on its successor story, ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=124}}  Alongside Hergé's ''Adventures of Tintin'', the magazine also included Laudy's ''The Legend of the Four Aymon Brothers'' and Jacobs' ''[[The Secret of the Swordfish]]'', the first in his new ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'' series.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=122}} While the magazine was in competition with a number of rivals, most notably ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', famous for serialising the ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' and ''[[Buck Danny]]'' comics,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=121}} it proved an immediate success, with 60,000 copies being sold in three days of its release.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=122}} Its publication resulted in a massive boost to Hergé's book sales too.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=124}}

In 1947 [[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|a Belgian film adaptation]] of ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations were a good way to proceed, Hergé contacted [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney Studios]] in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt ''The Adventures of Tintin'' for the silver screen.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=133|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=187–189}}
In May 1947 the artistic collaboration between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument. Hergé had been jealous of the immediate success of Jacobs' ''Blake and Mortimer'' series, and had turned down Jacobs' request that he be credited as co-creator of the new ''Adventures of Tintin''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=126–127|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=176–177}} That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=179}}

Many Belgians were highly critical of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; ''La Soir'' and ''La Cité'' publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while ''Le Quotidien'' and ''[[Communist Party of Belgium|Le Drapeau Rouge]]'' specifically singled him out for denunciation.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=122–123}} Hergé believed that the children's author [[Jeanne Cappe]] was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=130–131}} Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=131, 134|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=190–193}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=&quot;I've just discovered... that Tintin is no longer me, and that though he continued to live it is through a sort of artificial respiration that I must keep up constantly, and that is exhausting me more and more.&quot;|source=Hergé, in a letter to his wife, 1947{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=183}} }}

In May, Hergé and Germaine holidayed near to [[Gland, Switzerland|Gland]] on [[Lake Geneva]], Switzerland, where they were accompanied by a friend of theirs, a young woman named Rosane. During the holiday, Hergé and Rosane embarked on an extra-marital affair. He felt guilty, and returned to Brussels in June.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=193}} Privately, he expressed the view that he had been led to commit such an act, which he viewed as immoral, through the influence of &quot;amoral friends&quot; that he was associating with.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=194}} Hoping to reignite the passion and stability of his marriage, he arranged for he and Germaine to return to Switzerland soon after; here they argued, and embarked on a temporary separation.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=194}} Remaining in Switzerland, he visited King Leopold III, who was then holidaying in [[Pregny-Chambésy|Prégny]],{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=198}} before briefly returning to Brussels in July.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=201}} Back in Switzerland, he embarked on an affair with a married woman, although again informed Germaine before setting off to spend time in [[Ardenne]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=201–202}} In August, the couple sought to reunite by holidaying together in [[Brittany]], but there they broke up again and Hergé returned to his lover in Switzerland.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=202–203}} In September he finally returned to Brussels,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=203}} but with his close friend Marcel Dehaye then spent time in a retreat at the [[Scourmont Abbey|Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=127–129|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=204–205}} That month, he revived ''Land of Black Gold'' – the ''Adventure of Tintin'' that had been interrupted by the German invasion of 1940 – and began serialising it in ''Tintin'' magazine.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=59}} However, the story was again interrupted, this time for twelve weeks as Hergé took a further unannounced holiday to Gland, greatly annoying many of his colleagues.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=210–214}}

Although they retained respect for each other, Hergé's repeated absences had created a tense situation between himself and Leblanc.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=214}} After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of ''Tintin'' magazine in France: Georges Dargaud's [[Le Lombard]], which began production of a French edition in October 1948.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=131|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=203}} However, Hergé was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed André Frenez as Van Melkebeke's replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as &quot;a cold functionary&quot;.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=142}} Hergé was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine's artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt that they did not meet his exacting standards.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=139}} He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at ''Tintin'' and ''Kuifje'', [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Willy Vandersteen]], encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=215}} To Leblanc, he expressed the concern that most of those working at ''Tintin'' were better illustrators than storytellers.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=169|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=237}} He also opined that ''Tintin'' was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=235–237}}

===Studios Hergé and Fanny Vlamynck: 1950–65===

On 6 April 1950 Hergé established [[Studios Hergé]] as a [[public company]].{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=141|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=147|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=226}} The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=226}} with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in [[Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve|Céroux-Mousty]] his and Germaine's main abode.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=229}}
The Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=148}}
Initially with only three employees, this would rise to fifteen, with all working on Hergé's projects.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=149}} He hired [[Bob de Moor]] as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=152–153|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=231}} Impressed by Jacques Martin's work on ''The Golden Sphinx'', Hergé persuaded Martin to join the Studios in January 1954; Martin insisted on bringing with him his own two assistants, [[Roger Leloup]] and Michel Demaurets.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=153|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=249–250}}
During the early 1950s, a number of those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi occupiers were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at ''Tintin'' magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=149–150|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=233–234}} For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=150|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=234–235}} He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the [[Walloon Legion]],{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=149|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=250}} and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at ''Le Nouveau Journal'' during the occupation.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=150|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=248}}

Hergé had developed the idea of setting an ''Adventure of Tintin'' on the moon while producing ''Prisoners of the Sun''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=135}} He began serialisation of ''[[Destination Moon (comics)|Destination Moon]]'', the first of a two part arc followed by ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'', in ''Tintin'' magazine in March 1950.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=63}} In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story,{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=227|2a1=Goddin|2y=2011|2p=13}} feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=227–228}} Many readers sent letters to ''Tintin'' asking why ''Explorers on the Moon'' was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=230}} ''Explorers of the Moon'' would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=149|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=141|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=232}}
Alongside his work on the new stories, Hergé also made use of the Studios in revising more of his early works.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=159}}

In February 1952, Hergé was involved in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=179|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=239}} Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=179|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=240}} His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged [[clairvoyant]], Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=240–242}} In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, with the rest of the studio staff soon finding out.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=180|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=260–361}} Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=261}} Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited [[Casablanca]], [[Rabat]], [[Palermo]], and [[Rome]], and in October went on a second holiday, this time to [[Ostend]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=262}} Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=263}}
He began experiencing traumatic dreams dominated by the colour white, and seeking to explain them he visited Franz Ricklin, a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] who was a student of [[Carl Jung]] in [[Zurich]] in May 1959.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=190–191|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=275–278}} In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon its arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in [[Uccle]], away from Germaine.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=285}} His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law he was unable to obtain a divorce until seventeen years later.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=285}}

[[File:Herge's abstract artwork.jpg|thumb|right|One of Hergé's abstract artworks]]

In September 1958, ''Tintin'' magazine moved its headquarters to a newly constructed building near the [[Gare du Midi]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=265}} Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over the direction of the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to [[Sardinia]] for six weeks.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=291–292}} In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist [[Greg (cartoonist)|Greg]] to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=197|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=292}} By this point, ''Tintin'' magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his interest in it.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=292}}

Hergé's book sales were higher than ever, and translations were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=264}} He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in ''[[France-Observateur]]'', ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', and ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=266}} Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, ''Le Monde de Tintin'' (&quot;The World of Tintin&quot;), published by [[Gallimard]]; Hergé vetoed the inclusion of a proposed preface by [[Roger Nimier]] after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=181–183|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=266–267}} Radio adaptations of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' were produced,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=267}} as was an animated cartoon series produced by [[Belvision]], ''[[Hergé's Adventures of Tintin]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=267}} Two live-action films were also produced, ''[[Tintin and the Golden Fleece]]'' (1961) and ''[[Tintin and the Blue Oranges]]'' (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=227|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=268}}

Developing an interest in [[modern art]], in the early 1960s Hergé befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=216–217|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=303}} He was a particular fan of the work of [[Constant Permeke]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Lucio Fontana]], and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the [[pop art]] movement, in particular the work of [[Roy Lichtenstein]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=304}} He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as [[African art]] and [[Chinese ceramics]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=215–216}}
In 1962, Hergé decided he wanted to paint. He chose [[Louis Van Lint]], one of the most respected Belgian [[Abstract art|abstract painters]] at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Farr|2y=2007|2p=39}}
Hergé took up painting as a hobby,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=295}} producing abstract art works which were influenced by the styles of [[Joan Miró]] and [[Serge Poliakoff]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=302}} He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=302}} Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=302}}
Spending less time on new ''Adventures of Tintin'', from June to December 1965 ''Tintin'' magazine serialised a redrawn and newly coloured version of ''The Black Island'' prepared by staff at Studios Hergé.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=293}} Supported by his studio, Hergé produced ''[[The Calculus Affair]]'' between 1954 until 1956 which was followed by ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'' in 1956 to 1957.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=175–8; 260}}

===Final years: 1966–83===

In the 1960s, Hergé became increasingly annoyed at the success of [[René Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo]]'s ''[[Asterix]]'' comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing ''The Adventures of Tintin'' as the foremost comic in the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian tradition]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=297–298}} Hoping to imitate the success of the recent animated films ''[[Asterix the Gaul (film)|Asterix the Gaul]]'' (1967) and ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra (film)|Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the ''Adventures of Tintin''. The first, ''[[Tintin and the Temple of the Sun]]'' (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, ''[[Tintin and the Lake of Sharks]]'' (1972) was an original story written by [[Greg (cartoonist)|Greg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=226|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=299}} In 1982 the American filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of ''The Adventures of Tintin'', a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=228–229|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=338–339}}

In October 1971, the journalist [[Numa Sadoul]] conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, in which the latter opened up about many of the problems he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as ''[[Tintin et moi]]'' (&quot;Tintin and I&quot;) in 1975.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=207–208|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=315–317}} Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, ''[[I, Tintin|Moi, Tintin]]'' (&quot;I, Tintin&quot;), which premiered in 1975.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=318}}
In January 1977 he attended an early comic book convention at [[Angoulême]], where he was widely heralded as one of the masters of the discipline.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=238}} To mark the fiftieth anniversary of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1979, a celebratory event was held at Brussels' Hilton hotel, while an exhibit on &quot;Le Musée imaginaire de Tintin&quot; (&quot;The Imaginary Museum of Tintin&quot;) was held at the Palais de Beaux-Arts.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=329}}

In April 1971 Hergé visited the United States for the first time, primarily to visit a liver specialist in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], but on the trip he also visited a [[Sioux]] reservation in [[South Dakota]], but was shocked at the conditions in which their inhabitants' lived. On this visit he also spent time in [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Las Vegas]], and [[Kansas City]]. 
{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=168|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=301}} In April 1972 he travelled to [[New York City]] for an international conference on the strip cartoon, and there presented Mayor [[John Lindsay]] with a cartoon of Tintin visiting the city and also met with the pop artist [[Andy Warhol]].{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=174}} Several years later, in 1977, Warhol visited Europe, where he produced a pop art portrait of Hergé.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Goddin|2y=2011|2p=190}}
In April 1973, Hergé took up an invite to visit [[Taiwan]] by the nation's government, in recognition of his promotion of Chinese culture in ''The Blue Lotus''. During the visit he also spent time in Thailand and Bali.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=177|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=318–319}}

[[File:Tombe d'Hergé Friedhof Uccle Bruxelles.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Hergé's grave in the cemetery ''Du Dieweg'' in Brussels]]

Hergé had long sought to regain contact with his old friend [[Zhang Chongren]], with whom he had lost contact. He regularly asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=184|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=319–320}} The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=225|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=333}}

In June 1970, Hergé's father died, and after the funeral he holidayed near Lake Geneva.{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=168}}
In 1974, his assistant Branden suffered a stroke and was left unable to write, with Hergé replacing him with a young man, Alain Baran,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=328–329}} who Hergé biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] later termed Hergé's &quot;surrogate son&quot;.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=211}} In March 1977, Hergé's divorce with Germaine was finalised; although Hergé continued to visit her and financially support her, Germaine took the divorce badly, viewing it as a further betrayal.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=328}} Hergé was then able to marry Fanny several weeks later, in a low-key ceremony on 20 May; he was 70 years old and she 42.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=190|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=328}} 

In 1979, Hergé was diagnosed with [[osteomyelofibrosis]], necessitating a complete blood transfusion.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=232|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=330}} His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=232|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=333, 334}} On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered [[cardiac arrest]] and was hospitalised in [[intensive care]] at Brussels' [[Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=234|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=334}} He died there on 3 March.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=234|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=334}} His death received [[headline|front page]] coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including ''[[Libération]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=205}} In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=233}} In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the [[Hergé Foundation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=210|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=338}} In 1988, ''Tintin'' magazine was discontinued.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=338}}

==Personal life==
Hergé was a highly private person,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} being described by biographer [[Harry Thompson]] as &quot;reserved [and] unostentatious&quot;.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=155}} According to his biographer Pierre Sterckx, Hergé appeared &quot;very conventional&quot; in public but in reality was &quot;extremely erudite, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly on the watch&quot;.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=7}} He greatly enjoyed walking in the countryside,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=92}} gardening,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} and art collecting,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} and he was a fan of [[jazz music]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=156|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=206–207}} Although he disliked making public or press appearances,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=155}} Hergé insisted on personally responding to all [[fan mail]] received, which took up a considerable part of his time.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=151}} He stated that &quot;not replying to children's letters would be to betray their dreams.&quot;{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=313}} Friends described him as a humorous man, known particularly for his [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] jokes.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} Colleagues described Hergé as [[egocentric]], an assessment he agreed with.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} He was known to be authoritarian in dealing with his assistants and refused to share credit with them for their part in his work.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=147, 208|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=154}} Sterckx noted that &quot;on the one hand he could be distant, even frosty, but on the other he was affectionate&quot;.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=7}}

Throughout his first marriage he had a number of affairs with other women.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=134}} He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment,{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=211|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=206}} but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for Hergé, deeming him awkward around children.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=211|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=258–259}} Hergé was raised as a [[Catholic]] although was never a devout practitioner of the religion.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=12}} His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in [[Taoism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=185, 212–213|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=332}} and became an [[agnosticism|agnostic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=208|2a1=Sterckx|2y=2015|2p=12}} He was a fan of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and [[Arnaud Desjardins]]' ''[[The Path to Wisdom]]'',{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=213}} as well as [[Fritjof Capra]]'s ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and the work of [[Jean-Émile Charon]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=332}}

===Political views===
Politically, Hergé was a fervent [[royalism|royalist]], and remained so throughout his life,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=147}} also believing in the unity of Belgium.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=210}}
In his early life, Hergé was &quot;close to the traditional right-wing&quot; of Belgian society,{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|p=9}} with Sterckx noting that through his work he was &quot;plunged into rightist, even extreme right-wing circles&quot;.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=54}} According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were not unusual in middle-class circles in Belgium of the 1920s and early 1930s, where &quot;patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline and naivety were so inextricably bound together in everyone's lives that right-wing politics were an almost inevitable by-product. It was a world view shared by everyone, distinguished principally by its complete ignorance of the world.&quot;{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=24}} When Hergé took responsibility for {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingtième]]''}}, he followed Wallez's instruction and allowed the newspaper to contain explicitly pro-fascist and [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] sentiment.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=38}} Literary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolidès]] noted that the character of Tintin was a personification of the &quot;New Youth&quot; concept which was promoted by the European far right.{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|p=10}} Under Wallez's guidance, the early ''Adventures of Tintin'' contained explicit political messages for its young readership. ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'' was a work of [[anti-socialism|anti-socialist]] propaganda,{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=12}} while ''Tintin in the Congo'' was designed to encourage colonialist sentiment toward the [[Belgian Congo]],{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=26|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24|3a=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=45}} and ''Tintin in America'' was designed as a work of anti-Americanism heavily critical of capitalism, commercialism, and industrialisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=35|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=56}}

In contrast to Hergé's involvement in Belgium's right-wing, Sterckx thought the cartoonist to have been &quot;a liberal and independent spirit&quot;,{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=54}} someone who was &quot;the very opposite of a conservative [or] a reactionary of the right&quot;.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=7}} [[Michael Farr]] asserted that Hergé had &quot;an acute political conscience&quot; during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in ''Tintin in America''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=29}} Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] went further, remarking that ''Tintin in America'' represented the emergence of a &quot;left-wing counter tendency&quot; in Hergé's work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=38}} This was furthered in ''The Blue Lotus'', in which Hergé rejected his &quot;classically right-wing&quot; ideas to embrace an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] stance,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=76–77, 82}} and in a contemporary ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' strip in which he lampooned the far right leaders of Germany and Italy, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=148}} Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Hergé did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he &quot;had always had an aversion to it&quot; and commenting that &quot;to throw my heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am.&quot;{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=89}}

===Accusations of racism===
[[File:Angry King in Tintin.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A comics strip panel.  A heavily-caricatured African king jumps in the air angrily, saying, &quot;Curses! ... Our military done for! ... By my ancestors, me myself kill miserable white man!&quot; |The King of the M'Hatuvu in the 1946 version of ''Tintin in the Congo''; such depictions have widely been labelled racist.]]
Hergé has faced repeated accusations of racism due to his portrayal of various ethnic groups throughout ''The Adventures of Tintin''.
According to McCarthy, in ''Tintin in the Congo'' Hergé represented the Congolese as &quot;good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery.&quot;{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=37}} Thompson commented that Hergé had not written the book to be &quot;deliberately racist&quot;, arguing that it reflected the average early 20th century Belgian view of the Congolese, one which was more &quot;patronising&quot; than malevolent.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} Indeed, it provoked no controversy at the time,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=28}} only coming to be perceived as racist in the latter 20th century.{{sfn|Time|2010}} In the following adventure, ''Tintin in America'', Hergé depicted members of the [[Blackfoot]] tribe of Native Americans as &quot;gullible, even naive&quot;, though it was nevertheless &quot;broadly sympathetic&quot; to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States army.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=29}} In ''The Blue Lotus'', he depicted the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed, which has also drawn accusations of racism.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=62–63}}

Hergé has also been accused of utilising [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] stereotypes. The character of Rastapopoulos has been claimed to be based on anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Hergé's protestations that the character was Italian, and not Jewish.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=42|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=64–65}}

In contrast to his racial stereotyping, from his early years, Hergé was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of United States society in a prelude comment to ''Tintin in America'' published in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' on 20 August 1931,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=56}} and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in ''The Blue Lotus''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=62|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=77}} Peeters asserted that &quot;Hergé was no more racist than the next man&quot;,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}} an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Hergé in the 1980s commented that &quot;you couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist&quot;.{{sfn|BBC News|2010}} In contrast, President of the International ''Bande Dessinée'' Society Laurence Grove opined that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that &quot;When it was fashionable to be a Nazi, he was a Nazi. When it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was.&quot;{{sfn|BBC News|2010}}

According to the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Index Translationum]], Hergé is the ninth-most-often-translated French-language author, the second-most-often-translated Belgian author after [[Georges Simenon]], and the second-most-often-translated French-language comics author behind [[René Goscinny]].{{sfn|Index Translationum}} He also had an asteroid, [[1652 Hergé]], within the [[main belt]], named after him in 1953.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=175}}

===In popular culture===
A cartoon version of Hergé makes a number of [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] appearances in [[Ellipse Programme|Ellipse]]-[[Nelvana]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' [[animated series|TV cartoon series]]. An animated version of Hergé also makes a cameo appearance at the start of the 2011 [[performance capture]] film, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and produced by [[Peter Jackson]], where he is depicted as a street cartoonist drawing a portrait of Tintin at the start of the film.{{sfn|The Guardian|2011}}

===Hergé Museum===
[[Image:2001-2009 Hergé museum, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgique, 01.jpg|thumb|The Hergé Museum, concept and construction between 2001–09]]

The [[Musée Hergé]] is located in the centre of [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], a city to the south of Brussels.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}} This location was originally chosen for the Museum in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning French architect [[Christian de Portzamparc]] and cost €15 million to build.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}} On the centenary of the birth of Hergé, 22 May 2007, the museum's first stone was laid. The museum opened its doors in June 2009.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}}

The idea of a museum dedicated to the work of Hergé can be traced back to the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the [[Hergé Foundation]] and then by the new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}}

The Hergé Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Hergé, and telling the story of his life and career which had not previously been visible to the public.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}}{{sfn|Time|2009}} The Museum also houses a temporary exhibition gallery. Although Tintin features prominently in the museum, Hergé's other comic strip characters, such as Jo, Zette and Jocko, and Quick and Flupke, as well as his work as a graphic designer, are also present.{{sfn|Time|2009}}

[[File:Horned God.JPG|thumb|A sculpture of the Horned God Bucca of Cornish Traditional Witchcraft, found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]].]]

The '''Horned God''' is one of the two primary deities found in [[Wicca]] and some related forms of [[Neopaganism]]. 
The term ''Horned God'' itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century [[syncretism|syncretic]] term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with partly [[pseudohistorical]] origins, partly based on historical [[Horned deity|horned deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bailey ''Witchcraft Historiography (review)'' in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horned God represents the [[God (Wicca)|male part]] of the religion's [[Wiccan ditheism|duotheistic theological system]], the [[Prince consort|consort]] of the female [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of the Moon or other [[Mother Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druidry.org/library/gods-goddesses/horned-god-unofficial-autobiography |title=from the library of the Order of Bards, Ovates &amp; Druids |publisher=Druidry.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle.&lt;ref name=farrargod&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |first=Janet |last=Farrar |author2=Farrar, Stewart |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-3319-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–34}} Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s or [[antler]]s upon his head, often depicted as being [[Theriocephaly|theriocephalic]] (having a beast's head), in this way emphasizing &quot;the union of the divine and the animal&quot;, the latter of which includes [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horns of Power |publisher=Avalonia |location=London |first=Sorita |last=d'Este |year=2008 |pages=|isbn=1-905297-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} 

In traditional Wicca ([[British Traditional Wicca]]) , he is generally regarded as a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] god of twofold aspects: bright and dark, night and day,  summer and winter,  the Oak King and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]].  In this dualistic view, his two horns symbolize, in part, his dual nature.  (The use of horns to symbolize duality is also reflected in the phrase &quot;on the horns of a dilemma.&quot;) The three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God are sometimes mapped on to the five points of the [[Pentagram]],  although which points correspond  to which deity aspects  varies. In some other systems, he is represented as a [[triple deities|triune]] [[god]], split into three aspects that reflect those of the Triple Goddess: the [[wikt:youth|Youth]] ([[Warrior]]), the [[wikt:father|Father]], and the [[Sage (philosophy)|Sage]].

The Horned God has been explored within several [[psychology|psychological]] theories, and has become a recurrent theme in [[fantasy]] literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia_of_fantasy&quot;&gt;

==In Wicca==
[[File:Gundestrup Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The &quot;Cernunnos&quot; type antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]]]
In traditional and mainstream Wicca, the Horned God is viewed as the masculine side of divinity, being both equal and opposite to the Goddess. The Wiccan god himself can be represented in many forms, including as the [[Solar deity|Sun God]], the Sacrificed God and the Vegetation God,&lt;ref name=&quot;farrargod&quot;/&gt; although the Horned God is the most popular representation. The pioneers of the various Wiccan or Witchcraft traditions, such as [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], [[Doreen Valiente]] and [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]], all claimed that their religion was a continuation of the [[Paganism|pagan]] religion of the [[Witch-Cult]] following historians who had purported the Witch-Cult's existence, such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

For Wiccans, the Horned God is &quot;the personification of the life force energy in animals and the wild&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Starhawk&quot; in News-Week On-faith [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/starhawk/2006/11/some_basic_definitions.html Some basic definitions] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with [[Lord of the animals|the wilderness]], virility and [[Hunting God|the hunt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Doreen Valiente]] writes that the Horned God also [[Psychopomp|carries the souls of the dead to the underworld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt;

Wiccans generally, as well as some other neopagans, tend to conceive of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of [[masculinity|male]] and [[femininity|female]] [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]]. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the [[Goddess (Wicca)|Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The [[Wheel of the Year]]. The seasonal cycle is imagined to follow the relationship between the Horned God and the Goddess.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot; /&gt; The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot; /&gt; The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the [[autumn equinox]], or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans conceive of the Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call [[Samhain]], the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] says (in 1959's ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'') that The Horned God is an Under-god, a mediator between an unknowable supreme deity and the people. (In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as &quot;Dryghtyn.&quot; It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)

Whilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the [[Green Man]] and the [[solar deity|Sun God]].&lt;ref name=farrargod/&gt; In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing the Horned God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called the Horned God &quot;the eldest of gods&quot; in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To The Horned God.

Wiccans believe that The Horned God, as Lord of Death, is their &quot;comforter and consoler&quot; after death and before reincarnation; and that he rules the [[Underworld]] or [[The Summerland|Summerland]] where the souls of the dead reside as they await rebirth. Some, such as Joanne Pearson, believe that this is based on the [[Mesopotamian]] myth of [[Inanna]]'s [[Inanna#Inanna's descent to the underworld|descent into the underworld]], though this has not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Horned God and Mother Goddess (Doreen Valiente's Altar).jpg|thumb|right|Altar statues of the Horned God and Mother Goddess crafted by Bel Bucca and owned by the &quot;Mother of Wicca&quot;, [[Doreen Valiente]]]]

[[Doreen Valiente]], a former High Priestess of the [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian tradition]], claimed that Gerald Gardner's [[Bricket Wood coven]] referred to the god as [[Cernunnos]], or '''Kernunno''', which is a Latin word, discovered on a [[pillar of the Boatmen|stone carving found in France]], meaning &quot;the Horned One&quot;. Valiente claimed that the coven also referred to the god as '''Janicot''' (pronounced Jan-e-co),{{needs IPA}} which she theorised was of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin, and Gardner also used this name in his novel ''High Magic's Aid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Doreen |last=Valiente |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-8369-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

[[Stewart Farrar]], a High Priest of the [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian tradition]] referred to the Horned God as Karnayna, which he believed was a corruption of the word Cernunnos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=What Witches Do |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Stewart |last=Farrar |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-9014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] has suggested that it instead came from the Arabic term [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] which meant &quot;Horned One&quot;. This term had been used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] to refer to [[Cyrus the Great]] or alternatively [[Alexander the Great]], who considered himself the son of the horned deity Ammon-Zeus, and wore horns as a part of his regalia. Margaret Murray had mentioned this information in her 1933 book ''The God of the Witches'', and Hutton theorised that [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] had taken it from there, enjoying the fact that he shared his name with the ancient Macedonian emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;triumph&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Triumph of the Moon: a History of Modern Pagan Witchcaraft |publisher=Oxford Paperbacks |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-19-285449-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}}

In the writings of [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Raymond Howard (Wiccan)|Raymond Howard]], the god was referred to as '''Atho'''. Howard had a wooden statue of Atho's head which he claimed was 2200 years old, but the statue was stolen in April 1967. Howard's son later admitted that his father had carved the statue himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/coven_of_atho%20article.htm#_ednref22 |title=The Coven of Atho |publisher=Thewica.co.uk |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8swU6zn?url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/coven_of_atho%20article.htm#_ednref22 |archivedate=2015-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cochrane's Craft]], which was founded by [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], the Horned God was often referred to by a Biblical name; [[Tubal-cain]], who, according to the [[Bible]] was the first blacksmith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roebuck&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Mike |last=Howard |title=The Roebuck in the Thicket: An Anthology of the Robert Cochrane Witchcraft Tradition |publisher=Capall Bann Publishing |isbn=1-86163-155-3 |year=2001 }} Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; In this neopagan concept, the god is also referred to as [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]], a Welsh mythological figure, [[Wayland the Smith|Wayland]], the smith in Germanic mythology, and [[Herne the Hunter|Herne]], a horned figure from [[English folklore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roebuck&quot;/&gt;

In the neopagan tradition of [[Stregheria]], founded by [[Raven Grimassi]] and loosely inspired by the works of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]], the Horned God goes by several names, including [[Janus|Dianus]], [[Faunus]], Cern, and [[Actaeon]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==In psychology==

===Jungian analysis===
Sherry Salman considers the image of the Horned God in [[Jungian]] terms, as an archetypal protector and mediator of the outside world to the objective psyche. In her theory the male psyche's 'Horned God' frequently compensates for inadequate fathering.

When first encountered, the figure is a dangerous, 'hairy chthonic wildman' possessed of kindness and intelligence. If [[psychological repression|repressed]], later in life The Horned God appears as the lord of the Otherworld, or [[Hades]]. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion.

In considering the Horned God as a symbol recurring in women's literature, Richard Sugg suggests the Horned God represents the 'natural Eros', a masculine lover subjugating the social-conformist nature of the female shadow, thus encompassing a combination of the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and animus. One such example is [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] from [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. Sugg goes on to note that female characters who are paired with this character usually end up socially ostracised, or worse &amp;ndash; in an inverted ending to the male hero-story.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Gehörnter Gott, Enkomi.jpg|thumb|Bronze figurine of a &quot;Horned God&quot; from [[Enkomi]], Cyprus]]
[[horned deity|Many horned deities]] are known to have been worshipped in various cultures throughout history. Several theories have been created to establish historical roots for modern [[Neopagan]] worship of a Horned God.

===Margaret Murray===
Following the writings of [[suffragist]] [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and others, [[Margaret Murray]], in her 1921 book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'', proposed the theory that the witches of the early-modern period were remnants of a pagan cult and that the Christian Church had declared the god of the witches was in fact [[the Devil]]. Without recourse to any specific representation of this deity, Murray speculates that the head coverings common in [[inquisition]]-derived descriptions of the devil &quot;may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MurrayWitch&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Margaret Murray |last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The Witch-cult in Western Europe (1921)|year=2006|publisher=Standard Publications|isbn=1-59462-126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nejamesa horned god of India.png|thumb|left|Horned God [[Naigamesha]] of the Indian sub-religion [[Kaumaram]]. Possibly from the Shunga period (1st-2nd century B.C), or earlier]]
In 1931 Murray published a sequel, ''The God of the Witches'', which tries to gather evidence in support of her witch-cult theory. In Chapter 1 &quot;The Horned God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MurraGod&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The God of the Witches (1931)|year=1970|isbn=0-19-501270-4|publisher=OUA USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray attempts to claim that various depictions of humans with horns from [[Europe]]an and [[India]]n sources, ranging from the [[paleolithic]] French cave painting of &quot;[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]&quot; to the Indic [[Pashupati]] to the modern English [[Dorset Ooser]], are evidence for an unbroken, Europe-wide tradition of worship of a singular Horned God. Murray derived this model of a horned god cult from [[James Frazer]] and [[Jules Michelet]].&lt;ref&gt;

In dealing with '[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|23–4}} the earliest evidence claimed, Murray based her observations on a drawing by [[Henri Breuil]], which modern scholars such as Ronald Hutton claim is inaccurate. Hutton states that modern photographs show the original cave art lacks horns, a human torso or any other significant detail on its upper half. Breuil considered his drawing to represent a shaman or magician - an interpretation which gives the image its name. Murray having seen the drawing called Breuil's image 'the first depiction of a deity', an idea which Breuil and others later adopted. Hutton's theory led him to conclude that reliance on Bruiel's initial sketch resulted in many later scholars erroneously claiming that &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was evidence that the concept of a Horned God dated back to Paleolithic times&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

Murray also used an inaccurate drawing of a [[mesolithic]] rock-painting at [[El Cogul|Cogul]] in northeast Spain as evidence of group religious ceremony of the cult, although the central male figure is not horned.&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|65}} The illustration she used of the Cogul painting leaves out a number of figures, human and animal, and the original is more likely a sequence of superimposed but unrelated illustrations, rather than a depiction of a single scene.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;{{rp|197}}

Despite widespread condemnation of Murray's scholarship some minor aspects of her work continued to have supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Other historians, like Byloff and Bonomo, have been willing to build upon the useful aspects of Murray's work without adopting its untenable elements, and the independent and careful researches of contemporary scholars have lent aspects of the Murray thesis considerable new strength.&quot; — J. B. Russell (1972) ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages''. Cornell University Press. p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences from literature====
The popular image of the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] was removed from its classical context in the writings of the [[Romantics]] of the 18th century and connected with their ideals of a pastoral England. This, along with the general public's increasing lack of familiarity of [[Greek mythology]] at the time led to the figure of Pan becoming generalised as a 'horned god', and applying connotations to the character, such as benevolence that were not evident in the original Greek myths which in turn gave rise to the popular acceptance of Murray's hypothetical horned god of the witches.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;

{{Main|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches#Influence on Wicca and Stregheria}}
The reception of ''Aradia'' amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of [[Leo Martello]] and [[Raven Grimassi]], must be &quot;match[ed] against&quot;, and compared with the claims in ''Aradia''. He further suggests that a lack of comfort with ''Aradia'' may be due to an &quot;insecurity&quot; within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifton&quot;&gt;

Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of [[Lucifer]] as the god of the witches in ''Aradia'' was &quot;too strong meat&quot; for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Valiente61&quot;&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]], quoted in Clifton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis#Post-Murray}}
In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;LuckArcana&quot; /&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;LuckArcana&quot; /&gt;

====Influences from occultism====
[[Image:Baphomet.png|thumb|The 19th century image of a Sabbatic Goat, created by [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]]. Baphomet serves as an historical model for Murray's concept.]]

Eliphas Levi's image of &quot;[[Baphomet]]&quot; serves as an example of the transformation of the Devil into a benevolent fertility deity and provided the prototype for Murray's horned god.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt; Murray's central thesis that images of the Devil were actually of [[deities]] and that [[Christianity]] had demonised these worshippers as following [[Satan]], is first recorded in the work of Levi in the fashionable 19th-century [[Occult]]ist circles of England and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;Juliette Wood, &quot;[http://www.juliettewood.com/papers/Tarot.pdf The Celtic Tarot and the Secret Traditions: A Study in Modern Legend Making]&quot;: ''Folklore'', Vol. 109, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Levi created his image of Baphomet, published in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), by combining symbolism from diverse traditions, including the ''[[The Devil (Tarot card)|Diable]]'' card of the 16th and 17th century [[Tarot of Marseille]]. Lévi called his image &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following [[Herodotus]]' account&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 42, 46 and 166.&lt;/ref&gt; that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs.  Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly [[Zoophilia|copulated with a goat]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 46. [[Plutarch]] specifically associates [[Osiris]] with the &quot;goat at Mendes.&quot; [http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th140.htm ''De Iside et Osiride'', lxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] writes,

{{quote|At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus (ii. 46) instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html#ref32 i. 88]) compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 Budge, vol. ii, p. 353.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Historically, the deity that was venerated at Egyptian Mendes was a ram deity [[Banebdjedet]] (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled &quot;the Lord of Mendes&quot;), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram ''Banebdjed'' as a he-goat, further imagined by him as &quot;copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes&quot;.

===Gerald Gardner and Wicca===
[[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of the historical origins of the Horned God has been used by Wiccans to create a myth of historical origins for their religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot;/&gt;{{rp|110}}  There is no verifiable evidence to support claims that the religion originates earlier than the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;triumph&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Wicca#Theology}}
Modern scholarship has disproved Margaret Murray's theory, however various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early Medieval periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Blackwell |location= |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1991 |pages=260–261 |isbn=0-631-17288-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Gardner was initiated into [[Ordo Templi Orientis|the O.T.O.]] by Aleister Crowley and subsequently went on to found the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Philip Heselton]], and [[Leo Ruickbie]] concur that witchcraft's early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley's writings such as the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]]. The third degree initiation ceremony in Gardnerian Wicca (including the [[Great Rite]]) is derived almost completely from the Gnostic Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eocto.org/article/101 |title=Ecclesia Ordinis Caelestis Templum Olympicus - Thelemic Origins of Wicca |publisher=Eocto.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romano-Celtic fusion===
Georg Luck, repeats part of Murray's theory, stating that the Horned God may have appeared in late antiquity, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], an antlered god of the Continental Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;LuckArcana&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Georg Luck |last=Luck |first=Georg |year=1985 |title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts. |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of [[Devil|the devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;LuckArcana&quot;/&gt;

==Art, fantasy and science fiction==
[[Image:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Witches' Sabbath - WGA10007.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[Witches' Sabbath (1789)|Witches Sabbat]]'' (1789), which depicts [[the Devil]] flanked by Satanic witches. The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god]]In 1908's ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], in Chapter 7, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, Ratty and Mole meet a mystical horned being, powerful, fearsome and kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifton&quot;/&gt;{{rp|85}} Grahame's work was a significant part of the cultural milieu which stripped the Greek god Pan of his cultural identity in favor of an unnamed, generic horned deity which led to Murray's thesis of historical origins.

Outside of works that predate the publication of Murray's thesis, horned god motifs and characters appear in fantasy literature that draws upon her work and that of her followers.

In the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' (1953) by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], all humans have a collective premonition, also described as a memory of the future, of horned aliens which arrive to usher in a new phase of human evolution. The collective subconscious image of the horned aliens is what accounts for mankind's image of the devil or Satan. This theme is also explored in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]'' in 1971,  where the local superstitions around a landmark known as The Devil's Hump prove to be based on reality, as aliens from the planet Dæmos have been affecting man's progress over the millennia and the Hump actually contains a spacecraft.  The only Dæmon to appear is a classic interpretation of a horned satyr-like being with hooves.

In the critically acclaimed and influential 1950s TV series created by [[Nigel Kneale]], ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', depictions of supernatural horned entities, with specific reference to prehistoric cave-art and shamanistic horned head-dress are revealed to be a &quot;race-memory&quot; of psychic [[Martian]] grasshoppers, manifested at the climax of the film by a fiery horned god.&lt;ref&gt;White, Eric (1996) ''Once they were men: Now they're Landcrabs: Monsterous Becomings in Evolutionist Cinema'', in

[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], who acknowledges the influence of Murray, uses the figure of the &quot;horned god&quot; in her feminist fantasy transformation of [[King Arthur|Arthurian myth]], ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'' (1984), and portrays ritualistic incest between King Arthur as the representative of the horned god and his sister [[Morgan le Fay|Morgaine]] as the &quot;spring maiden&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

In the popular video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind|Morrowind]]'', its expansion ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon|Bloodmoon]]'' has a plot enemy known as Hircine, the Daedric god of the Hunt, who appears as a horned man with the face of a deer skull. He condemned his &quot;hounds&quot; ([[werewolves]]) to walk the mortal ground during the Bloodmoon until a champion defeats him or Bloodmoon falls. When in combat, Hircine appears as a horned wolf or bear.

The 1992 ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]], features a King of the Elves who is strongly reminiscent of the Horned God.  Although not worshipped by [[Witches (Discworld)|the witches]] who are the heroines of the book (indeed, quite the reverse), they temporarily ally themselves with him out of necessity.

'''Haggis''' is a [[Savoriness|savoury]] [[pudding]] containing [[sheep]]'s pluck ([[offal|heart, liver, and lungs]]); [[Mincing|minced]] with [[onion]], [[oatmeal]], [[suet]], [[spice]]s, and [[salt]], mixed with [[Stock (food)|stock]], traditionally encased in the animal's [[stomach]]&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; though now often in an artificial [[sausage casing|casing]] instead. According to the 2001 English edition of the ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'': &quot;Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Larousse Gastronomique | last = Montagné | first = Prosper | page = 592 | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that food similar to haggis (though not so named), perishable [[offal]] quickly cooked inside an animal's stomach, all conveniently available after a hunt, was eaten from ancient times.&lt;ref name=rome/&gt;&lt;ref name=necessity/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdr/&gt;&lt;!--this summarises text in body, sources repeated here as text was challenged--&gt;

Although the name &quot;hagws&quot; or &quot;hagese&quot; was first recorded in England c. 1430, the dish is considered traditionally of Scottish origin.&lt;!--English usage &amp; Scottish tradition sourced in #History--&gt; even the national dish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/experience-scotland/food-and-drink/|title=Food and Drink in Scotland&amp;nbsp;– Scottish Cuisine|work=Scotland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of Scots poet [[Robert Burns]]' poem ''[[Address to a Haggis]]'' of 1787. Haggis is traditionally served with &quot;[[rutabaga|neeps]] and [[potato|tatties]]&quot;, boiled and [[Mashed potato|mashed]] separately, and a [[Dram (unit)|dram]] (a glass of [[Scotch whisky]]), especially as the main course of a [[Burns Supper]].

==History and etymology==
Haggis is popularly assumed to be of [[Scotland|Scottish]] origin,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|haggis}} First recorded as &quot;hagws&quot; &quot;Now considered specially Scottish, but a popular dish in [early] English cookery&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a lack of historical evidence that could conclusively attribute its origins to any one place. The first known written recipes for a dish of the name made with [[offal]] and herbs, are, as &quot;hagese&quot;, in the verse cookbook ''[[Liber Cure Cocorum]]'' dating from around 1430 in [[Lancashire]], [[north west England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/lcc/parallel.html#q120|title=Liber cure Cocorum&amp;nbsp;– A Modern English Translation with Notes, Based on Richard Morris' transcription of 1862.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as &quot;hagws of a schepe&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/CookBk?type=simple&amp;rgn=full+text&amp;q1=hagws&amp;submit=Go|title=Corpus of Middle English Prose and Verse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an English cookbook also of c. 1430.

The Scottish poem &quot;[[Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy]]&quot;, which is dated before 1520 (the generally accepted date prior to the death of [[William Dunbar]], one of the composers), refers to 'haggeis'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Dunbar: Selected Poems|first=William|last=Dunbar|author2=Harriet Harvey Wood|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-96943-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Thy fowll front had, and he that Bartilmo flaid;
 The gallowis gaipis eftir thy graceles gruntill,
As thow wald for ane haggeis, hungry gled.|William Dunbar|Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy}}

An early printed recipe for haggis appears in 1615 in ''The English Huswife'' by [[Gervase Markham]]. It contains a section entitled &quot;Skill in Oate meale&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Gervase Markham| last = Markham | first = Gervase | title = The English House-wife, Containing the Inward and Outward Vertues Which Ought to Be in a Compleate Woman |edition=4| publisher = John Harison | page = 240 | year = 1631 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|The use and vertues of these two severall kinds of Oate-meales in maintaining the Family, they are so many (according to the many customes of many Nations) that it is almost impossible to recken all;&quot; and then proceeds to give a description of &quot;oat-meale mixed with blood, and the Liver of either Sheepe, Calfe or Swine, maketh that pudding which is called the Haggas or Haggus, of whose goodnesse it is in vaine to boast, because there is hardly to be found a man that doth not affect them|Gervase Markham|The English Huswife}}

Food writer [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] suggests that the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were the first known to have made products of the haggis type.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |last=Davidson |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Davidson (food writer) |year=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-280681-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, a kind of primitive haggis is referred to in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', in book 20, (towards the end of the 8th century BCE) when [[Odysseus]] is compared to &quot;a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.&quot; Haggis was &quot;born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=necessity&gt;[[Andrew Zimmern]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarissa Dickson Wright]] says that it &quot;came to Scotland in a [[longship]] [i.e., from [[Scandinavia]]] even before Scotland was a single nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barham | first = Andrea | title = The Pedant's Revolt: Why Most Things You Think Are Right Are Wrong | publisher = Michael O'Mara Books Ltd | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-84317-132-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She cites etymologist [[Walter William Skeat]] as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the ''hag–'' element of the word is derived from the [[Old Norse]] ''haggw'' or the [[Icelandic language|Old Icelandic]] ''hoggva''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-haggle.html '' The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', 1996]. Retrieved on 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (''höggva'' in modern Icelandic&lt;ref&gt;''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'', Page 309, [[Richard Cleasby]], [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]], [[George Webbe Dasent]]&amp;nbsp;– 1874&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Modern Scots]] ''hag'', meaning 'to hew' or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish.

Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling [[offal]] near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be [[grilling|grilled]] directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — probably in a vessel made from the [[animal's hide]] — was one way to make sure these parts were not wasted.&lt;ref name=cdr&gt;{{cite book | last = Dickson Wright | first = Clarissa | authorlink = Clarissa Dickson Wright | title = The Haggis: A Little History| publisher = Pelican Publishing Company | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-56554-364-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==
{{main|Wild Haggis}}
In the absence of hard facts as to haggis' origins, popular folklore has provided some notions. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish [[Drovers' road|cattle drovers]]. When the men left the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to drive their cattle to market in [[Edinburgh]] the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the [[glen]]s. They used the ingredients that were most readily available in their homes and conveniently packaged them in a sheep's stomach allowing for easy transportation during the journey. Other speculations have been based on Scottish slaughtering practices. When a [[Chiefs of the Name|chieftain]] or [[laird]] required an animal to be slaughtered for meat (whether sheep or cattle) the workmen were allowed to keep the [[offal]] as their share.

A joke sometimes maintained is that a haggis is [[Wild Haggis|a small Scottish animal]] with longer legs on one side, so that it can run around the steep hills of the Scottish highlands without falling over. According to one poll, 33 percent of American visitors to Scotland believed haggis to be an animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/27/travelnews.travel &quot;American tourists believe Haggis is an animal&quot;], guardian.co.uk, 2003-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haggis supper 1.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Haggis Supper from a chip shop]]

Haggis is traditionally served as part of the [[Burns supper]] on or near January 25, the birthday of Scotland's national poet [[Robert Burns]]. Burns wrote the poem ''[[Wikisource:Address to a Haggis|Address to a Haggis]]'', which starts &quot;Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o' the puddin-race!&quot; In Burns's lifetime haggis was a common dish of the poor as it was nourishing yet very cheap, being made from leftover parts of sheep otherwise discarded.

Haggis is widely available in supermarkets in Scotland all year, with cheaper brands normally packed in artificial casings, rather than stomachs. Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Some commercial haggis is largely made from pig, rather than sheep, offal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramsayofcarluke.co.uk/products/traditional-ball-haggis-1kg/|title=Traditional Ball Haggis (1kg)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosher haggis, not only pork-free but fully conformant to [[Jewish dietary laws]], is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejc.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx|title=The Jewish Chronicle ePaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional haggis recipe describes haggis as &quot;sheep's 'pluck' (heart, liver, and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and traditionally encased in the animal's stomach and boiled&quot;. Ingredients are sheep stomach, heart and lungs of one lamb, onions, oatmeal, salt, pepper, stock, and water, with optional ingredients dried coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It can be boiled, baked, or deep fried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obanargyll.com/haggis-recipe.html|title=Haggis recipe &amp; ingredients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetarian haggis===
Since the 1960s various Scottish shops and manufacturers have made what they call [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] haggis, substituting various [[pulse (legume)|pulses]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and vegetables for the meat.  There are also recipes for homemade vegetarian haggis.  [[Oats]] and [[barley]] may be included as may different types of [[lentil]]s, [[split pea]]s, [[aduki bean]]s, [[kidney bean]]s, [[borlotti bean]]s, [[peanut]]s, other nuts and [[mushroom]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[carrot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' (London) 22.01.2015 [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jan/22/how-to-cook-perfect-vegetarian-haggis How to cook the perfect vegetarian haggis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Scotland==
[[File:Haggis.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Haggis platter at a Burns Supper in the US]]
[[Image:Haggis scoticus.jpg|thumb|225px|A fictitious [[Wild Haggis]] ''Haggis scoticus'', next to a prepared specimen, as displayed at the [[Glasgow]] [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum|Kelvingrove Gallery]]]]

Haggis remains popular with Scottish immigrants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, owing to the strong influence of Scottish culture, especially for Burns Suppers. It can easily be made in any country, but is sometimes imported from Scotland. A recipe from the Canadian province of [[New Brunswick]] uses pork and bakes it in a loaf pan.

In 1971 it became illegal to import haggis into the US from the UK due to a ban on food containing sheep lung, which constitutes 10 – 15 percent of the traditional recipe.&lt;ref name=USABAN&gt;{{cite news|title=US not ready to lift ban on Scottish haggis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8480795.stm|work=BBC News|date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban encompasses all lungs, as fluids such as stomach acid and phlegm may enter the lung during slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/jpawpb/the-usda-doesnt-want-us-to-eat-lungs&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was further complicated in 1989 when all UK beef and lamb was banned from importation to the US due to a [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] crisis.&lt;ref name=USABAN/&gt; In 2010 a spokeswoman for the US Department of Agriculture stated that they were reviewing the ban on beef and lamb products, but that the ban on food containing sheep lung would remain in force.&lt;ref name=USABAN/&gt;

As haggis cannot be exported to the United States, it is instead made there, sometimes by Scottish companies. One such uses what is stated to be the same 150 year-old recipe and ingredients as in Scotland, except that sheep lung is not used, and the casing is always artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishhaggis.com/faqs.aspx|title=Frequently Asked Question's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
Haggis is used in a sport called [[haggis hurling]], which involves throwing a haggis as far as possible. The world record for haggis hurling was achieved by Lorne Coltart on 11 June 2011, who hurled his haggis {{convert|217|ft|abbr=on}}.  This throw surpassed the longstanding previous record of {{convert|180|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}, held by Alan Pettigrew since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lorne is haggis world record-breaker|url=http://www.milngavieherald.co.uk/news/local-headlines/lorne_is_haggis_world_record_breaker_1_1689505|publisher=Milngavie Herald(Scotland)|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehaggis.com/EZ/sh/sh/page08.php|title=Haggis in Sport|accessdate=2012-10-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409013011/http://www.thehaggis.com/EZ/sh/sh/page08.php|archivedate=2012-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his victory in [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] golf tournament in 1988, Scottish golfer [[Sandy Lyle]] served haggis at the annual Champions Dinner before the 1989 Masters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html The Course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |date=2008-01-09 }}. The Official Site of the Masters Tournament. Retrieved on 2007-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korean War]], the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] received {{convert|180|lb|kg}} of haggis from the [[No. 30 Transport Unit RAAF]] during &quot;Operation Haggis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=No. 36 Squadron |title=Operations Record Book |url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1358988&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1 |publisher= [[National Archives of Australia]] |date=1950–66 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Louis Aaron''' (born February 5, 1934), nicknamed &quot;'''Hammer'''&quot; or &quot;'''Hammerin' Hank'''&quot;, is a retired American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[right fielder]] who is currently the senior vice president of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. He played 21 seasons for the [[Milwaukee Braves|Milwaukee]]/[[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[National League]] (NL) and two seasons for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in the [[American League]] (AL), from 1954 through 1976. Aaron held the MLB record for career home runs for 33 years, and he still holds several MLB offensive records. He hit 24 or more home runs every year from 1955 through 1973, and is one of only two players to hit 30 or more home runs in a season at least fifteen times.&lt;ref name=30hr&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked Aaron fifth on its &quot;100 Greatest Baseball Players&quot; list.

Aaron was born and raised in and around [[Mobile, Alabama]]. Aaron had seven siblings, including [[Tommie Aaron]], who later played in MLB with him. Baseball was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] when Aaron began his career. He appeared briefly in the [[Negro American League]] and in [[minor league baseball]] before starting his major league career.&lt;ref name=&quot;angelfire&quot;/&gt; He played late in Negro league history; by his final MLB season, Aaron was the last Negro league baseball player on a major league roster.

Aaron played the vast majority of his MLB games in right field, though he appeared at several other infield and outfield positions. In his last two seasons, he was primarily a [[designated hitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bbref.com/m?p=XXplayersXXaXXaaronha01-field.shtml&amp;t=all_standard_fielding|title=Hank Aaron Fielding  Stats  - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron was an NL [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star]] for 20 seasons and an AL All-Star for 1 season, from 1955 through 1975.  Aaron holds the record for the most seasons as an All-Star and the most [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] selections (25),{{#tag:ref|MLB held two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962|group=lower-alpha}} and is tied with [[Willie Mays]] and [[Stan Musial]] for the most All-Star Games played (24). He was a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] winner for three seasons. In 1957, he was the NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player (MVP)]] when the Milwaukee Braves won the [[1957 World Series|World Series]]. He won the [[MLB Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month award]] in May 1958 and June 1967. Aaron holds the MLB records for the most career [[runs batted in]] (RBI) (2,297), [[extra base hit]]s (1,477), and [[total bases]] (6,856). Aaron is also in the top five for career [[hit (baseball)|hits]] (3,771) and [[run (baseball)|runs]] (2,174). He is one of only four players to have at least seventeen seasons with 150 or more hits.&lt;ref name=150h&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron is in second place in home runs (755) and [[at-bat]]s (12,364), and in third place in games played (3,298). At the time of his retirement, Aaron held most of the game's key career power hitting records.

Since his retirement, Aaron has held front office roles with the Atlanta Braves. He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1982. In 1999, MLB introduced the [[Hank Aaron Award]] to recognize the top offensive players in each league. He was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2002. He was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee by the [[Georgia Historical Society]] in recognition of accomplishments that reflect the ideals of Georgia's founders. Aaron resides near [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Aaron was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]], to Herbert Aaron, Sr. and Estella (Pritchett) Aaron.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bily|2002|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had seven [[sibling]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; [[Tommie Aaron]], one of his brothers, also went on to play [[Major League Baseball]]. By the time Aaron retired, he and his brother held the record for most career home runs by a pair of siblings (768). They were also the first siblings to appear in a [[1969 National League Championship Series|League Championship Series]] as teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was born in a section of Mobile referred to as &quot;Down the Bay&quot;, he spent most of his youth in [[Toulminville]]. Aaron grew up in a poor family.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt;  His family could not afford baseball equipment, so he practiced by hitting bottle caps with sticks. He would create his own bats and balls out of materials he found on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemec|1994|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; His boyhood idol was baseball star [[Jackie Robinson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BladeIdol&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Jackie Robinson Aaron's boyhood idol|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19740401&amp;id=jfNOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4106,282900&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 6, 2016|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=April 1, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron attended Central High School as a [[Ninth grade|freshman]] and a [[Tenth grade|sophomore]]. Like most high schools they did not have organized baseball, and so he played [[outfield]] and [[third base]] for the [[Mobile Black Bears]], a semipro team.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Gilbert|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron was a member in the [[Boy Scouts of America]].

Although he batted cross-handed (i.e., as a right-handed hitter, with his left hand above his right), Aaron established himself as a power hitter. As a result, in 1949, at the age of fifteen, Aaron had his first tryout with an MLB franchise, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers#Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]; however, he did not make the team.&lt;ref name=angelfire&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=br33/&gt; After this, Aaron returned to school to finish his secondary education, attending the Josephine Allen Institute, a private high school in Alabama. During his [[Eleventh grade|junior year]], Aaron first joined the [[Pritchett Athletics]],&lt;ref name=br33&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Mobile Black Bears]], an independent [[Negro league baseball|Negro league]] team.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; While on the Bears, Aaron earned $3 per game (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10|1951|r=0}}}} today), which was a dollar more than he got while on the Athletics.&lt;ref name=br33/&gt;

===Negro league and minor league career===
On November 20, 1951, baseball scout [[Ed Scott (baseball scout)|Ed Scott]] signed Aaron to a contract on behalf of the [[Indianapolis Clowns]] of the [[Negro American League]] where he played three months.&lt;ref name=jrank6&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013d}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/stealing-home/Content?oid=2176530|title=Stealing Home |accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started play as a {{convert|6|ft|cm}}, {{convert|180|lb|kg}}, shortstop,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and earned $200 per month.&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{harvnb|Candee|1958|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his standout play with the [[Indianapolis Clowns]], Aaron received two offers from MLB teams via [[telegram]], one from the [[New York Giants (MLB)|New York Giants]] and the other from the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. Years later, Aaron remembered:
: &quot;I had the Giants' contract in my hand. But the Braves offered fifty dollars a month more. That's the only thing that kept [[Willie Mays]] and me from being teammates&amp;nbsp;– fifty dollars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honig|2000|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While with the Clowns he experienced some [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|overt racism]]. His team was in Washington, D.C.
: &quot;We had breakfast while we were waiting for the rain to stop, and I can still envision sitting with the Clowns in a restaurant behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating. What a horrible sound. Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: here we were in the capital in the land of freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had been in the mouths of black men. If dogs had eaten off those plates, they'd have washed them.&quot;&lt;ref name=TB&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|Thorn|p=819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Howe Sports Bureau credits Aaron with a .366 [[batting average]] in 26 official Negro league games, with 5 [[home run]]s, 33 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBI), 41 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], and 9 [[stolen base]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vascellaro|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Braves purchased Aaron from the Clowns for $10,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which GM [[John Quinn (baseball executive)|John Quinn]] thought was a steal as he stated that he felt that Aaron was a $100,000 property.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; On June 12, 1952, Aaron signed with Braves' scout Dewey Griggs.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt;  During this time, he picked up the nickname '[[pork chops]]' because it &quot;was the only thing I knew to order off the menu.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teammate later said, &quot;the man ate pork chops three meals a day, two for breakfast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollock|2006|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Braves assigned Aaron to the [[Eau Claire Bears]], the Braves' [[Northern League (baseball, 1902–71)|Northern League]] [[Class C (baseball)|Class-C]] [[farm team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; The 1952 season proved to be very beneficial for Aaron. Playing in the [[infield]], Aaron continued to develop as a ballplayer and made the Northern League's All-Star team.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; He broke his habit of hitting cross-handed and adopted the standard hitting technique. By the end of the season, he had performed so well that the league made him the unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year.&lt;ref name=angelfire /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt;  Although he appeared in just 87 games, he scored 89 [[run (baseball)|runs]], had 116 hits, nine home runs, and 61 RBI.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; In addition, Aaron hit for a .336 batting average.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; During his minor league experience, he was very homesick and faced constant racism, but his brother, Herbert Jr., told him not to give up the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|2002|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the Braves promoted him to the [[Jacksonville Braves]], their Class-A affiliate in the [[South Atlantic League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; Helped by Aaron's performance, the Braves won the league championship that year. Aaron led the league in runs (115), hits (208), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (36), RBI (125), total bases (338), and batting average (.362).&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; He won the league's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; and had such a dominant year that one [[sportswriter]] was prompted to say, &quot;Henry Aaron led the league in everything except hotel accommodations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;/&gt; Aaron's time with the Braves did not come without problems. He was one of the first [[African American]]s to play in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s were a period of [[racial segregation]] in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the country. When Aaron traveled around [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the surrounding areas, he was often separated from his team because of [[Jim Crow laws]]. In most circumstances, the team was responsible for arranging housing and meals for its players, but Aaron often had to make his own arrangements.&lt;ref name=blecherreport&gt;{{cite web |title=This Day in Black Sports History: February 5, 1934 |author=Ronald Monestime |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/599197-this-day-in-black-sports-history-february-5-1934 |publisher=bleacherreport.com |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves' manager, [[Ben Geraghty]], tried his best to help Aaron on and off the field. Former Braves minor league player and sportswriter [[Pat Jordan (author)|Pat Jordan]] said, &quot;Aaron gave [Geraghty] much of the credit for his own swift rise to stardom.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|2005|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Aaron met his future wife, Barbara Lucas. The night they met, Lucas decided to attend the Braves' game. Aaron singled, doubled, and hit a home run in the game. On October 6, Aaron and Lucas married.&lt;ref name=CB2&gt;{{harvnb|Candee|1958|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Aaron's wife noted that during the offseason he liked &quot;to sit and watch those shooting westerns.&quot; He also enjoyed cooking and fishing.&lt;ref name=CB2/&gt;

Aaron spent the winter of 1953 playing in [[Puerto Rico]]. [[Mickey Owen]], the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Up to that time, Aaron hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was able to hit the ball more effectively all over the [[Baseball field|field]].&lt;ref name=angelfire /&gt;{{better source|reason = angelfire.com is not a reliable source|date=May 2014}} During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron to transition from second baseman to outfielder. Aaron had not played well at second base, but Owen had noted that Aaron could catch fly balls and throw the ball well from the outfield to the infield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vascellaro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vascellaro|first1=Charlie|title=Hank Aaron: A biography|date=2005|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0313330018|pages=46–47|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UPRd-lu3stwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stint in Puerto Rico also allowed Aaron to avoid being drafted into military service. Though the [[Korean War]] was over, people were still being drafted. The Braves were able to speak to the draft board, making the case that Aaron could be the player to integrate the [[Southern Association]] the following season with the [[Atlanta Crackers]]. The board appears to have been convinced, as Aaron was not drafted.&lt;ref name=Vascellaro/&gt;

==MLB career==
1954 saw Aaron attending spring training with the major league club. Although he was on the roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager [[Charley Grimm]] later stated, &quot;From the start, he did so well I knew we were going to have to carry him.&quot;&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder [[Bobby Thomson]] fractured his [[ankle]] while [[slide (baseball)|sliding]] into [[second base]] during a [[spring training]] game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' [[Major League Baseball|major league]] team, playing in left field and hitting a home run.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; This led Hank Aaron to a major league contract, signed on the final day of spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, Aaron made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander [[Joe Nuxhall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Gilbert|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same game, [[Eddie Mathews]] hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off Cardinals' pitcher [[Vic Raschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted .280 with thirteen homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a &quot;lucky number&quot; for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2010|p=541}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]], who coincidentally also wore number 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, Aaron was known to family and friends primarily as &quot;Henry.&quot; Braves' public relations director Don Davidson, observing Aaron's quiet, reserved nature, began referring to him publicly as &quot;Hank&quot; in order to suggest more accessibility. The nickname quickly gained currency, but &quot;Henry&quot; continued to be cited frequently in the media, both sometimes appearing in the same article, and Aaron would answer to either one. During his rookie year, his other well-known nicknames, &quot;Hammerin' Hank&quot; (by teammates) and &quot;Bad Henry&quot; (by opposing pitchers) are reported to have arisen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musick|1974|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime of his career===
[[File:Hank Aaron 1960.png|thumb|upright|Aaron with the Braves in 1960]]
Aaron hit .314 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI, in 1955. He was named to the NL All-Star roster for the first time; it was the first of a record 21 All-Star selections and first of a record 25 All-Star Game appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, Patrick.

SportsData http://www.sportsdatallc.com. Retrieved April 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956, Aaron hit .328 and captured the first of two NL batting titles. He was also named ''[[The Sporting News]]'' NL Player of the Year. In 1957, Aaron won his only NL MVP Award,&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; as he had his first brush with the triple crown.&lt;ref name=sew/&gt; He batted .322, placing third, and led the league in home runs and runs batted in.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; On September 23, 1957, Aaron hit a two-run game-ending home run in Milwaukee, clinching the pennant for the Braves and being carried off the field by his teammates. Milwaukee went on to win the [[1957 World Series|World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]], the defending champions.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; Aaron did his part by hitting .393 with three homers and seven RBI. On December 15, 1957, his wife gave birth to twins.&lt;ref name=CB2/&gt; Two days later, one of the children died.&lt;ref name=CB2/&gt; In 1958, Aaron hit .326, with 30 home runs and 95 RBI. He led the Braves to another pennant, but this time they lost a seven-game [[1958 World Series|World Series]] to the Yankees. Aaron finished third in the MVP race and he received his first of three [[Gold Glove Award]]s. During the next several years, Aaron had some of his best games and best seasons as a major league player. On June 21, 1959, against the [[San Francisco Giants]], he hit three two-run home runs. It was the only time in his career that he hit three home runs in a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Aaron nearly won the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|triple crown]]. He led the league with 44 home runs and 130 RBI and finished third in [[batting average]].&lt;ref group = nb&gt;His average was .319, .007 behind the leader, [[Tommy Davis]].&lt;/ref&gt; In that season, Aaron became the third player to [[30–30 club|steal 30 bases and hit 30 home runs]] in a single season. Despite that, he again finished third in the MVP voting. The Braves moved from [[Milwaukee]] to [[Atlanta]] after the 1965 season. In 1968, Aaron was the first Atlanta Braves player to hit his 500th career home run, and in 1970, he was the first Atlanta Brave to reach 3,000 career hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yuhasz|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home run milestones and 3,000th hit===
During his days in Atlanta, Aaron reached a number of [[milestone]]s; he was only the eighth player ever to hit 500 career home runs, with his 500th coming against [[Mike McCormick (pitcher)|Mike McCormick]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] on July 14, 1968—exactly one year after former Milwaukee Braves teammate Eddie Mathews had hit his 500th.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron was, at the time, the second-youngest player to reach that plateau.&lt;ref group =nb&gt;Aaron was 34 years, five months and nine days old. [[Jimmie Foxx]] was the youngest to reach the mark at the time. Since then, [[Alex Rodriguez]] has become the youngest to reach this mark.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th home run, passing [[Mickey Mantle]]'s total; this moved Aaron into third place on the career home run list, after Willie Mays and [[Babe Ruth]]. At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.

In 1970, Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 3,000th hit, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], the team against which he played in his first major-league game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron established the record for most seasons with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] (played at Detroit's [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run of the season against the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]' [[Jerry Johnson (baseball)|Jerry Johnson]] on August 10, which established a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with a career-high .669 [[slugging percentage]]) and finished third in MVP voting for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list. Aaron also knocked in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a close, Aaron broke [[Stan Musial]]'s major-league record for total bases (6,134). Aaron finished the season with 673 home runs.

===Breaking Ruth's record===
[[File:hank aaron jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|The Braves' jersey Hank Aaron wore when he broke [[Babe Ruth]]'s career home run record in 1974]]
Aaron himself downplayed the &quot;chase&quot; to surpass Babe Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the national media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home runs record. Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the summer of 1973, including hate mail; the Braves ended up hiring a secretary to help him sort through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the [[Houston Astros]] (managed by [[Leo Durocher]], who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After the game, Aaron stated that his only fear was that he might not live to see the [[1974 MLB season|1974 season.]] &lt;!-- The following sentence needs to be clarified or removed. Did Aaron speak of Clemente's death in this context?: [That statement wasn't just about the death threats: one year earlier, September 30, 1972 was the last day that the legendary [[Roberto Clemente]] ever played, as he perished in the offseason.] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the recipient of [[death threat]]s during the 1973–1974 offseason and a large assortment of hate mail from people who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth's nearly [[wikt:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] home run record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. [[Lewis Grizzard]], then sports editor of the ''Atlanta Journal'', reported receiving numerous phone calls calling journalists &quot;nigger lovers&quot; for covering Aaron's chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, he quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grizzard|1990|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' pointedly summarized the [[racism|racist]] vitriol that Aaron was forced to endure:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Is this to be the year in which Aaron, at the age of thirty-nine, takes a [[Extra-vehicular activity|moon walk]] above one of the most hallowed individual records in American sport...? Or will it be remembered as the season in which Aaron, the most dignified of athletes, was besieged with hate mail and trapped by the cobwebs and goblins that lurk in baseball's attic?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|1973|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the [[US Postal Service]] for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response to the [[bigotry]]. Newspaper cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] created a series of ''[[Peanuts]]'' strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 11 strip, &quot;Hank Aaron is a great player...but you! If you break Babe Ruth's record, it'll be a disgrace!&quot; Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the [[1973 MLB season|1973 season]] one home run short of Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schulz|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babe Ruth's widow, [[Claire Merritt Hodgson|Claire Hodgson]], even denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in [[Cincinnati]] with a three-game series against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Braves management wanted him to break the record in [[Atlanta]], and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But [[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]] ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record in his very first at bat—on his first swing of the season—off Reds pitcher [[Jack Billingham]], but did not hit another home run in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Minter|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The fence outside of Turner Field over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists.]]

The Braves returned to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on [[NBC]]. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;/&gt; Although Dodgers outfielder [[Bill Buckner]] nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' [[bullpen]], where [[relief pitcher]] [[Tom House]] caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students &lt;ref name=&quot;vdtstudents&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Poling|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful [[Craig Sager]] actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now [[WWSB]]-Channel 40) in Sarasota.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiestand|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer [[Milo Hamilton]], calling the game on [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: &quot;Henry Aaron, in the second inning walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Justice|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster [[Vin Scully]] addressed the racial tension&amp;nbsp;— or apparent lack thereof&amp;nbsp;— in his call of the home run: &quot;What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And for the first time in a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past several months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for Roger Alexander and [[Dave May]]. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate [[Del Crandall]], who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time [[Run batted in|RBI]] record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213.

This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]].

Aaron hit his 755th and final home run on July 20, 1976, at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] off [[Dick Drago]] of the [[California Angels]], which stood as the MLB career home run record until it was broken in 2007 by [[Barry Bonds]]. Over the course of his record-breaking 23-year career, Aaron had a batting average of .305 with 163 hits a season, while hitting an average of just over 32 home runs a year and knocking home 99 runs batted in ([[RBIs]]) a year. He had 100+ RBIs in a season 15 times, including a record 13 in a row.&lt;ref name=sew&gt;{{harvnb|Wolpin|1990|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1976 season, Aaron rejoined the Braves as an executive.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; On August 1, 1982, he was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]], having received votes on 97.8 percent of the ballots, second only to [[Ty Cobb]], who had received votes on 98.2% of the ballot in the inaugural 1936 Hall of Fame election.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBLib&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Braunstein|Wolpin|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron was then named the Braves' vice president and director of player development. This made him one of the first minorities in Major League Baseball upper-level management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since December 1980, he has served as senior vice president and assistant to the Braves' president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;/&gt;  He is the corporate vice president of community relations for [[Turner Broadcasting|TBS]], a member of the company's board of directors and the vice president of business development for The Airport Network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;/&gt; On January 21, 2007, Major League Baseball announced the sale of the Atlanta Braves. In that announcement, Baseball Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] also announced that Aaron would be playing a major role in the management of Braves, forming programs through major league baseball that will encourage the influx of minorities into baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blum|2007}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron founded the Hank Aaron Rookie League program.&lt;ref name=rob&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson, Jr.|1999|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His autobiography, ''I Had a Hammer'' was published in 1990. The book's title is a play on his nickname, &quot;The Hammer&quot; or &quot;Hammerin' Hank&quot;, and the title of the folk song &quot;[[If I Had a Hammer]]&quot;. Aaron now owns Hank Aaron [[BMW]] of south Atlanta in [[Union City, Georgia]], where he gives an [[autograph]]ed baseball with every car sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sports stars of Alabama: Where are they now?  |url=http://alabamaliving.coop/article/sports-stars-of-alabama-where-are-they-now/ |accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron also owns [[Mini (marque)|Mini]], [[Land Rover]], [[Toyota]], [[Hyundai]] and [[Honda]] dealerships throughout Georgia, as part of the Hank Aaron Automotive Group. Aaron sold all but the Toyota dealership in [[McDonough, Georgia|McDonough]] in 2007. Additionally, Aaron owns a chain of 30 restaurants around the country. During the [[2006 in baseball|2006 season]], [[San Francisco Giants]] slugger [[Barry Bonds]] passed Babe Ruth and moved into second place on the all-time home run list, attracting growing media coverage as he drew closer to Aaron's record. Playing off the intense interest in their perceived rivalry, Aaron and Bonds made a television commercial that aired during [[Super Bowl XLI]], shortly before the start of the [[2007 in baseball|2007 baseball season]], in which Aaron jokingly tried to persuade Bonds to retire before breaking the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013e}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonds began to close in on the record during the 2007 season, Aaron let it be known that, although he recognized Bonds' achievements, he would not be present when Bonds broke the record.&lt;ref name=&quot;workers2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbel|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was considerable speculation that this was a snubbing of Bonds based on the widespread belief that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs and [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]] to aid his achievement. However, some observers looked back on Aaron's personal history, pointing out that he had downplayed his own breaking of Babe Ruth's all-time record and suggesting that Aaron was simply treating Bonds in a similar fashion. In a later interview with Atlanta sportscasting personality Chris Dimino, Aaron made it clear that his reluctance to attend any celebration of a new home run record was based upon his personal conviction that baseball is not about breaking records, but simply playing to the best of one's potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;workers2007&quot;/&gt; After Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run on August 7, 2007, Aaron made a surprise appearance on the [[JumboTron]] video screen at [[AT&amp;T Park]] in San Francisco to congratulate Bonds on his accomplishment:{{quote|I would like to offer my congratulations to Barry Bonds on becoming baseball's career home run leader. It is a great accomplishment which required skill, longevity, and determination. Throughout the past century, the home run has held a special place in baseball and I have been privileged to hold this record for 33 of those years. I move over now and offer my best wishes to Barry and his family on this historical achievement. My hope today, as it was on that April evening in 1974, is that the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams.}}Aaron lives in the Atlanta area.&lt;ref name=AL/&gt; In July 2013, media reported that his home was burglarized.

Aaron was awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] in 1976, from the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|naacp.com|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Aaron was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] during his first year of eligibility. In 1988 Aaron was inducted into the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] for his time spent on the Milwaukee Braves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wisconsin Sports Development Corporation|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, MLB created the [[Hank Aaron Award]], to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Aaron's surpassing of Babe Ruth's career home run mark of 714 home runs and to honor Aaron's contributions to baseball. The award is given annually to the baseball hitters voted the most effective in each respective league. That same year, baseball fans named Aaron to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. In 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Hank Aaron on his list of [[100 Greatest African Americans]].

When the city of [[Atlanta]] was converting [[Centennial Olympic Stadium]] into a new baseball stadium, many local residents hoped the stadium would be named for Hank Aaron. When the stadium was instead named [[Turner Field]] (after Atlanta Braves owner [[Ted Turner]]), a section of Capitol Avenue running past the stadium was renamed Hank Aaron Drive. The stadium's street number is 755, after Aaron's total number of home runs; the 755 street number was retained for Turner Field's replacement, [[SunTrust Park]]. In April 1997, a new baseball facility for the AA [[Mobile Bay Bears]] constructed in Aaron's hometown of [[Mobile, Alabama]] was named [[Hank Aaron Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013f}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia State University]] acquired Turner Field and its surrounding parking lots in 2017, and university officials plan to build a new baseball park on the former [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] site, incorporating the left field wall where Aaron hit his record-breaking home run. 

On February 5, 1999, at his 65th birthday celebration, [[Major League Baseball]] announced the introduction of the [[Hank Aaron Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Sporting News|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award honors the best overall offensive performer in the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]. It was the first major award to be introduced in more than thirty years and had the distinction of being the first award named after a player who was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HONORARY DEGREE RECIPIENT |url=http://www.marquette.edu/universityhonors/honors_aaron.shtml|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he ranked fifth on ''[[The Sporting News]]''{{-'}} list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013g}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000 and again in July 2002, Aaron threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], played at [[Turner Field]] and [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2001, Hank Aaron was presented with the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Messina|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the nation's highest civilian honor, from President [[George W. Bush]] in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Office of the Press Secretary|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a recreational trail in Milwaukee connecting [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] with [[Lake Michigan]] along the [[Menomonee River]] was dedicated as the &quot;Hank Aaron State Trail&quot;. Hank Aaron was on hand for the dedication. Aaron is on the Board of Selectors of [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jefferson Awards|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaron was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach [[Vince Lombardi|Lombardi]]'s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.

Aaron dedicated the new exhibit &quot;Hank Aaron-Chasing the Dream&quot; at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] on April 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of Aaron stand outside the front entrance of both [[Turner Field]] and [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]. There is also a statue of him as an eighteen-year-old shortstop outside Carson Park in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013i}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played his first season in the Braves' minor league system.

He was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee by the [[Georgia Historical Society]], in conjunction with the [[Governor of Georgia]], to recognize accomplishments and community service that reflect the ideals of the founding body of [[Trustee Georgia|Trustees]], which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Brimmer|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron received the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], Gold Rays with Rosette in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hank Aaron presented with Order of the Rising Sun|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14571492/japan-honors-hank-aaron-order-rising-sun|accessdate=January 15, 2016|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sangreal.jpg|thumb|''How at the Castle of Corbin a Maiden Bare in the Sangreal and Foretold the Achievements of Galahad'': illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1917]]
The '''Holy Grail''' is a vessel that serves as an important motif in [[Arthurian literature]]. Different traditions describe it as a cup, dish or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness, eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance.

A &quot;grail&quot;, wondrous but not explicitly holy, first appears in ''[[Perceval, le Conte du Graal]]'', an unfinished romance written by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman (1991). [http://print.google.com/print?id=DGQcsXGYII4C ''The Grail: From Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol'']. Princeton. {{ISBN|0-691-02075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, it is a processional [[salver]], a tray, used to serve at a feast.&lt;ref&gt;Staines, David.(Trans.) The Complete Romances of Chrétien de Troyes. Indiana University Press, Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis, 1990, page 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrétien's story attracted many continuators, translators and interpreters in the later 12th and early 13th centuries, including [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], who perceived the grail as a Stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Von Eschenbach 1980, page 239&quot;&gt;Von Eschenbach, Wolfram. Parzival. Hatto, A.T. translator. Penguin Books, 1980, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 12th century, [[Robert de Boron]] wrote in ''Joseph d'Arimathie'' that the Grail was [[Jesus]]'s vessel from the [[Last Supper]], which [[Joseph of Arimathea]] used to catch [[Blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] at the [[Crucifixion]]. Thereafter, the Holy Grail became interwoven with the legend of the [[Holy Chalice]], the Last Supper cup, a theme continued in works such as the [[Vulgate Cycle]], the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, Joseph 1990, page 210&quot;&gt;Campbell, Joseph. Transformations of Myth Through Time. Harper &amp; Row Publishers, New York, 1990, page 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have long speculated on the origins of the Holy Grail before Chrétien, suggesting that it may contain elements of the trope of magical cauldrons from [[Celtic mythology]] combined with Christian legend surrounding the [[Eucharist]],&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Jessie L.  From Ritual To Romance. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1993 (originally published 1920) p.74 &amp; p.129,&lt;/ref&gt; the latter found in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] sources, conceivably in that of the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine Mass]], or even Persian sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Emma and von Franz, Marie-Louise. The Grail Legend, Sigo Press, Boston, 1980, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''graal'', as it is earliest spelled, comes from [[Old French]] ''graal'' or ''greal'', cognate with [[Old Provençal]] ''grazal'' and [[Catalan language|Old Catalan]] ''gresal'', meaning &quot;a cup or bowl of earth, wood, or metal&quot; (or other various types of vessels in different [[Occitan]] dialects).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diez, Friedrich 1864, p. 236&quot;&gt;Diez, Friedrich. An etymological dictionary of the Romance languages, Williams and Norgate, 1864, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly accepted etymology derives it from [[Latin]] ''gradalis'' or ''gradale'' via an earlier form, ''cratalis'', a derivative of ''crater'' or ''cratus'', which was, in turn, borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[krater]]'' (κρατήρ, a large wine-mixing vessel).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diez, Friedrich 1864, p. 236&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nitze, William A. Concerning the Word Graal, Greal, Modern Philology, Vol. 13, No. 11 (Mar., 1916), pp. 681-684 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Emma and von Franz, Marie-Louise. The Grail Legend, Princeton University Press, 1998, pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skeat, Walter William. Joseph of Arimathie, Pub. for the Early English Text Society, by N. Trübner &amp; Co., 1871, pp. xxxvi-xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Eduard. Etymologisches Wörterbuch der englischen Sprache: A-K, chettler, 1865, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative suggestions include a derivative of ''cratis'', a name for a type of woven basket that came to refer to a dish,&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard. The Holy Grail: imagination and belief, Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; or a derivative of Latin ''gradus'' meaning &quot;'by degree', 'by stages', applied to a dish brought to the table in different stages or services during a meal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard O'Gorman, &quot;Grail&quot; in Norris J. Lacy, ''The Arthurian Encyclopedia'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Late medieval writers such as [[Thomas Malory]] invented a fanciful new etymology for  [[Old French]] ''san-graal'' (or ''san-gréal''), meaning &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, by parsing it as ''san graal'', meaning &quot;royal blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard, The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief, Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; After the cycle of Grail [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] was well established, later writers used this alternative etymology. Since then, &quot;Sang real&quot; is sometimes employed to lend a medievalising air in referring to the Holy Grail. This connection with royal blood bore fruit in a modern bestseller linking many historical conspiracy theories ([[#Modern interpretations|see below]]).

==Medieval literature==

[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Galahad]], [[Bors]] and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail. Tapestry woven by [[William Morris|Morris &amp; Co.]]. Wool and silk on cotton warp, [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]].]]
The Grail was considered a bowl or dish when first described by Chrétien de Troyes. [[Hélinand of Froidmont]] described a grail as a &quot;wide and deep saucer&quot; (''scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda''); other authors had their own ideas. Robert de Boron portrayed it as the vessel of the Last Supper. The [[Wales|Welsh]] romance ''Peredur'' had no Grail per se, presenting the hero instead with a platter containing his kinsman's bloody, severed head.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, Lady Charlotte. The Mabinogion. A Facsimile Reproduction of the Complete 1877 Edition, Academy Press Limited Edition 1978, Chicago, Ill. page 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chrétien de Troyes===
The Grail is first featured in ''[[Perceval, le Conte du Graal]]'' (''The Story of the Grail'') by [[Chrétien de Troyes]], who claims he was working from a source book given to him by his patron, Count [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip of Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;According to a French scholar, the book given by Philip I may be Ovid's ''The Metamorphoses'', in [http://www.zetetique.fr/index.php/nl/450-poz-76#dossier/ POZ #76](in french)&lt;/ref&gt; In this incomplete poem, dated sometime between 1180 and 1191, the object has not yet acquired the implications of holiness it would have in later works. While dining in the magical abode of the [[Fisher King]], Perceval witnesses a wondrous procession in which youths carry magnificent objects from one chamber to another, passing before him at each course of the meal. First comes a young man carrying a bleeding lance, then two boys carrying candelabras. Finally, a beautiful young girl emerges bearing an elaborately decorated ''graal'', or &quot;grail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Staines, David.(Trans.) The Complete Romances of Chrétien de Troyes. Indiana University Press, Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis, 1990, page 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrétien refers to this object not as &quot;The Grail&quot; but as &quot;a grail&quot; (''un graal''), showing the word was used, in its earliest literary context, as a common noun. For Chrétien a grail was a wide, somewhat deep dish or bowl, interesting because it contained not a pike, salmon, or lamprey, as the audience may have expected for such a container, but a single Mass wafer which provided sustenance for the Fisher King's crippled father. Perceval, who had been warned against talking too much, remains silent through all of this and wakes up the next morning alone. He later learns that if he had asked the appropriate questions about what he saw, he would have healed his maimed host, much to his honour. The story of the Wounded King's [[inedia|mystical fasting]] is not unique; several saints were said to have lived without food besides communion, for instance Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]]. This may imply that Chrétien intended the Mass wafer to be the significant part of the ritual, and the Grail to be a mere prop.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman. The Grail: From Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, (1991), Page 184. Princeton. {{ISBN|0-691-02075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolfram von Eschenbach===
In ''[[Parzival]]'', [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], citing the authority of a certain (probably fictional) [[Kyot|Kyot the Provençal]], claimed the Grail was a Stone (called ''Lapsit exillis''&lt;ref name=&quot;Von Eschenbach 1980, page 239&quot;/&gt; which in alchemy is the name of the [[Philosopher's stone]]), the sanctuary of the neutral angels who took neither side during [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. [[Joseph Campbell]] considered ''Parzival'' the greatest of the Grail stories, told from a heroic view, where Parzival, is a married man and a self-motivated figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell, Joseph 1990, page 210&quot;/&gt;   There are [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] themes running through Wolfram's ''Parzival''.  Campbell sees the Grail as, &quot;...a stone vessel, which was brought down from heaven.  Now what he (Wolfram) is doing is imitating the [[Muslim]] [[Kaaba]], the stone at [[Mecca]] that was brought down from heaven&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Joseph. Transformations of Myth Through Time.

===Robert de Boron===
Though Chrétien's account is the earliest and most influential of all Grail texts, it was in the work of [[Robert de Boron]] that the Grail truly became the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and assumed the form most familiar to modern readers in its Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, Jessie L.  From Ritual To Romance. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1993 (originally published 1920) p.161.&lt;/ref&gt; In his verse romance ''Joseph d'Arimathie'', composed between 1191 and 1202, Robert tells the story of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] acquiring the chalice of the Last Supper to collect Christ's blood upon his removal from the cross. Joseph is thrown in prison, where Christ visits him and explains the mysteries of the blessed cup. Upon his release Joseph gathers his in-laws and other followers and travels to the west, and founds a dynasty of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.

The authors of the [[Vulgate Cycle]] used the Grail as a symbol of [[divine grace]]; Galahad, illegitimate son of [[Lancelot]] and [[Elaine of Corbenic|Elaine]], the world's greatest knight and the Grail Bearer at the castle of [[Corbenic]], is destined to achieve the Grail, his spiritual purity making him a greater warrior than even his illustrious father.&lt;ref&gt;The Quest of The Holy Grail, translated by Matarasso, P.M., Penguin Books, 1969, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Galahad and the interpretation of the Grail involving him were picked up in the 15th century by Sir [[Thomas Malory]] in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and remain popular today.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, Sir Thomas, Le Morte D’Arthur, Penguin Books, 1969, Volume II, page 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early literature===

Grail literature divides into two classes. The first concerns King Arthur's knights visiting the Grail castle or questing after the object. The second concerns the Grail's history in the time of Joseph of Arimathea.

The nine works from the first group are:
* The ''Perceval'' of Chrétien de Troyes.
* [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#The Continuations|Four continuations]] of Chrétien's poem, by authors of differing vision and talent, designed to bring the story to a close.
* The German ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], which adapted at least the holiness of Robert's Grail into the framework of Chrétien's story. In Wolfram von Eschenbach's telling, the Grail was kept safe at the castle of [[Munsalvaesche]] (''mons salvationis''), entrusted to Titurel, the first Grail King. Some, not least the Benedictine monks of Montserrat, have identified the castle with the real sanctuary of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]].
* The Didot ''Perceval'', named after the manuscript's former owner, and purportedly a prosification of Robert de Boron's sequel to ''Joseph d'Arimathie''.
* The [[Welsh romance]] ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg|Peredur]]'', generally included in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', likely at least indirectly founded on Chrétien's poem but including very striking differences from it, preserving as it does elements of pre-Christian traditions such as the Celtic cult of the head.
* ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', called the &quot;least canonical&quot; Grail romance because of its very different character.
* The German ''[[Diu Crône]]'' (''The Crown''), in which [[Gawain]], rather than Perceval, achieves the Grail.
* The ''[[Lancelot]]'' section of the vast [[Vulgate Cycle]], which introduces the new Grail hero, Galahad.
* The ''[[Queste del Saint Graal]]'', another part of the Vulgate Cycle, concerning the adventures of Galahad and his achievement of the Grail.

Of the second group there are:
* Robert de Boron's ''Joseph d'Arimathie'',
* The ''Estoire del Saint Graal'', the first part of the Vulgate Cycle (but written after ''Lancelot'' and the ''Queste''), based on Robert's tale but expanding it greatly with many new details.
* Verses by [[Rigaut de Berbezilh|Rigaut de Barbezieux]], a late 12th or early 13th century&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard. The Holy Grail: imagination and belief, Harvard University Press, 2004, p 418&lt;/ref&gt; Provençal troubador, where mention is made of Perceval, the lance, and the Grail (&quot;Like Perceval when he lived, who stood amazed in contemplation, so that he was quite unable to ask what purpose the lance and grail served&quot; - &quot;''Attressi con Persavaus el temps que vivia, que s'esbait d'esgarder tant qu'anc non saup demandar de que servia la lansa ni-l grazaus''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sayce, Olive. Exemplary comparison from Homer to Petrarch, DS Brewer, 2008, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Arts and literature===
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - The Damsel of the Sanct Grael (1874).jpg|thumb|right|''The Damsel of the Sanct Grael'' by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]]]
The story of the Grail and of the quest to find it became increasingly popular in the 19th century, referred to in literature such as [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s Arthurian cycle the ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. A sexualised interpretation of the grail, now identified with female genitalia, appeared in 1870 in [[Hargrave Jennings]]' book ''The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Writing of the Order of the Garter ceremonies Jennings writes on page 323:- The whole refers to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table; set round as sentinels ('in lodge') of the Sangreal, or Holy Graal--the 'Sacrifice Mysterious', or 'Eucharist'. But how is all this magic and sacred in the estimate of the Rosicrucians?' an inquirer will very naturally ask. The answer to all this is very, ample and satisfactory; but particulars must be left to the sagacity of the querist himself, because propriety does not admit of explanation. Suffice it to say, that it is one of the most curious and wonderful subjects which has occupied the attention of antiquaries. That archaeological puzzle, the 'Round Table of King Arthur', is a perfect display of this whole subject of the origin of the 'Garter'; it springs directly from it, being the same object as that enclosed by the mythic garter, 'garder', or 'girther.'&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of hushed reverence, chromatic harmonies and sexualized imagery in Richard Wagner's late opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', premiered in 1882, developed this theme, associating the grail – now periodically producing blood – directly with female fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Donington, Robert (1963). ''Wagner's &quot;Ring&quot; and its Symbols: the Music and the Myth''. Faber&lt;/ref&gt; The high seriousness of the subject was also epitomized in [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s painting in which a woman modeled by [[Alexa Wilding]] holds the Grail with one hand, while adopting a gesture of blessing with the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/dante-gabriel-rossetti-461|title= Rossetti, Dante Gabriel, 1828–1882, Tate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major mural series depicting the Quest for the Holy Grail was done by the artist [[Edwin Austin Abbey]] during the first decade of the 20th century for the [[Boston Public Library]]. Other artists, including [[George Frederic Watts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/230160?position=8|title= George Frederick Watts, 1860-62, Sir Galahad, oil on canvas, 191.8 x 107 cm, Harvard Art Museums, Fogg Museum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Dyce]], also portrayed grail subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Shichtman, Martin B.;  Carley, James P., (eds.)  Culture and the King: The Social Implications of the Arthurian Legend,  SUNY Press, Albany, N.Y., 1994, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarly hypotheses===
There has been some debate regarding the question whether the &quot;origin&quot; of the Grail legend should be seen as deriving from &quot;[[Celtic mythology]]&quot;.
This view was championed by [[Roger Sherman Loomis]], [[Alfred Nutt]] and [[Jessie Weston]].
Loomis traced a number of parallels between [[Medieval Welsh literature]] and Irish material and the Grail romances, including similarities between the ''[[Mabinogion]]''{{'}}s [[Bran the Blessed]] and the Arthurian [[Fisher King]], and between Bran's life-restoring cauldron and the Grail.

The opposing view dismissed the &quot;Celtic&quot; connections as spurious and interpreted the legend as essentially Christian in origin.
Joseph Goering of the [[University of Toronto]] has identified sources for Grail imagery in 12th century wall paintings from churches in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Pyrenees]] (now mostly removed to the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]), which present unique iconic images of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a bowl that radiates tongues of fire, images that predate the first literary account by [[Chrétien de Troyes]]. 
Goering argues that they were the original inspiration for the Grail legend.&lt;ref&gt;Goering, Joseph (2005). ''The Virgin and the Grail: Origins of a Legend''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-10661-0}}. [http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300106610]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rynor, Micah (October 20, 2005). [http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin6/051020-1720.asp &quot;Holy Grail legend may be tied to paintings&quot;]. www.news.utoronto.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber (2004) argued that the Grail legend is connected to the introduction of &quot;more ceremony and mysticism&quot; surrounding the sacrament of the Eucharist in the high medieval period, proposing that the first Grail stories may have been connected to the &quot;renewal in this traditional sacrament&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Richard (2004). ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'', Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-01390-5}}. [http://www.holygrail.ws]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scavone (1999, 2003) has argued that the &quot;Grail&quot;  in origin referred to the  [[Shroud of Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Scavone: &quot;Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and the Edessa Icon,&quot; [[Arthuriana]] vol. 9, no. 4, 3-31 (Winter 1999) ([http://www.shroud.it/SCAVONE1.PDF Article] and [http://www.shroud.com/scavone2.htm abstract]) ;Scavone, &quot;British King Lucius, the Grail and Joseph of Arimathea: The Question of Byzantine Origins.&quot;, Publications of the Medieval Association of the Midwest 10 (2003): 101-42, vol. 10, 101-142 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists [[Emma Jung]] and [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] used [[analytical psychology]] to interpret the Grail as a series of symbols in their book ''The Grail Legend''.&lt;ref name=Barber248&gt;Barber, 248–252.&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded on interpretations by [[Carl Jung]], which were later invoked by [[Joseph Campbell]].&lt;ref name=Barber248/&gt;

In 2016, Goulven Peron suggested that the Holy Grail may reflect the [[Cornucopia#In mythology|horn]] of the river-god [[Achelous]] as described by [[Ovid]] in the ''[[Metamorphoses (Ovid)|Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peron, Goulven 2016, p. 113&quot;&gt;Peron, Goulven. L'influence des Metamorphoses d'Ovide sur la visite de Perceval au chateau du Roi Pecheur, Journal of the International Arthurian Society, Vol. 4, Issue 1, 2016, p. 113-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudohistory===

The Grail legend was incorporated with the &quot;[[Priory of Sion]]&quot; hoax and popularised in the 1982 ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail|Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]''. The narrative developed here is that Jesus survived the cross to father children with [[Mary Magdalene]] whose descendants founded the [[Merovingian dynasty]]. The &quot;Grail&quot; is taken as a reference to Mary Magdalene and the Merovingian lineage as the &quot;receptacle&quot; of Jesus' bloodline (playing on the ''sang real'' etymology).&lt;ref&gt;Baigent, Michael; Leigh, Richard; Lincoln, Henry (1983). ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail.'' New York: Dell. {{ISBN|0-440-13648-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juliette Wood, &quot;The Holy Grail: From Romance Motif to Modern Genre&quot;, ''Folklore'', Vol. 111, No. 2. (October 2000), pp. 169-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]'' (1992), [[Graham Hancock]] asserts that the Grail story is a coded description of the [[Ark of the Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hancock | first = Graham | title = The Sign and the Seal: The Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant | publisher = Crown | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 0517578131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===

The Holy Grail later appeared in films; it debuted in a silent ''Parsifal''. ''[[The Silver Chalice]]'', a novel about the Grail by [[Thomas B. Costain]], was made into a 1954 film. In ''The Light of Faith'' (1922), [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] attempted to steal the Grail. ''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'' (1974) was made by [[Robert Bresson]]. ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) (adapted in 2004 as the stage production ''[[Spamalot]]'') was a comedic adaptation. [[John Boorman]], in his film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', attempted to restore a more traditional heroic representation of an Arthurian tale, in which the Grail is revealed as a mystical means to revitalise Arthur and the barren land to which his depressive sickness is connected. ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/|title= Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Fisher King]]'' are more recent and successful adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101889/|title= The Fisher King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grail is central in many modern Arthurian works, including [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]]'s novel ''War in Heaven'' and his two collections of poems about [[Taliesin|Taliessin]], ''Taliessin Through Logres'' and ''Region of the Summer Stars'', and in feminist author [[Rosalind Miles]]' ''Child of the Holy Grail''.   [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' presented the Grail as a symbol of water, part of a set of objects representing the four [[classical elements]]. The Grail also features heavily in [[Umberto Eco]]'s 2000 novel ''[[Baudolino]]''. and Robert B. Gregg's 2016 releases ''King Arthur &amp; The Holy Grail'', and ''The Holy Grail: More than a Legend'', both published by Avalon House Classics. The Grail has been used as a theme in fantasy, historical fiction and science fiction; a quest for the Grail appears in [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s series of books ''[[The Grail Quest]]'', set during the [[Hundred Years War]]. [[Michael Moorcock]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The War Hound and the World's Pain]]'' depicts a supernatural Grail quest set in the era of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. It is also a central theme in the ''[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)]]'' episode &quot;the Quest&quot;.

Influenced by the 1982 publication of the ostensibly non-fiction ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2003) the &quot;grail&quot; is taken assumed to refer to Mary Magdalene as the &quot;receptacle&quot; of Jesus' bloodline (playing on the ''sang real'' etymology).  In Brown's novel, it is hinted that this Grail was long buried beneath [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]], but that in recent decades its guardians had it moved to a secret chamber embedded in the floor beneath the ''[[La Pyramide Inversée|Inverted Pyramid]]'' in the entrance of the [[Louvre|Louvre museum]].

In the ''[[Fate/stay night|Fate]]'' series by [[Type-Moon]] and related spinoffs, the Holy Grail serves as the prize of the Holy Grail War, granting a single wish to the victor of the battle royale. However, it's hinted at throughout the series that this Grail is not the real chalice of Christ, but is actually an item of uncertain nature created by mages some generations ago.

In ''[[Persona 5]]'', the Holy Grail is the Treasure of the game's final Palace, representing the combined desires of all of humanity for a higher power to take control their lives and make a world that has no sense of individuality.

'''''Hunt the Wumpus''''' is an early [[computer game]], based on a simple [[hide and seek]] format featuring a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms.  It was originally developed as a [[text-based game]] written in [[BASIC]]. Due to the [[source code]] availability the game has since been [[Source port|ported]] to various [[programming language]]s and platforms including graphical versions.

== Development history==
[[File:4.3 BSD UWisc VAX Emulation Wump Manual.png|thumb|[[BSD|4.3 BSD]] [[man page]] for ''Hunt the Wumpus'' (&quot;wump&quot;)]]

''Hunt the Wumpus'' was originally written by [[Gregory Yob]] in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] while attending the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth|Dartmouth campus of the University of Massachusetts]] in 1975. Out of frustration with all the grid-based hunting games he had seen, such as ''[[Snark (game)|Snark]],'' ''[[Mugwump (game)|Mugwump]],'' and ''[[Hurkle]],'' Yob decided to create a map-based game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247 ''Hunt the Wumpus'' in ''The Best of Creative Computing, Volume 1'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hunt the Wumpus'' was first published in the ''[[People's Computer Company]]''&lt;ref&gt;The ''People's Computer Company,'' founded in October 1971, was a small non-profit group of independent educators who met in a small storefront on Menalto Rd. in [[Menlo Park, California]] during the 1970s.  The first issue of their journal, ''People's Computer Company,'' was published in October 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; journal Vol. 2 No. 1 in mid-1973, and again in ''[[Creative Computing]]'' in its October 1975 issue. This article was later reprinted in the book ''The Best of Creative Computing, Volume 1''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/index.php ''The Best of Creative Computing, Volume 1'']&lt;/ref&gt; Yob later developed ''Wumpus 2'' and ''Wumpus 3'', which offered more hazards and other cave layouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc2/showpage.php?page=244 ''Wumpus 2'' in ''The Best of Creative Computing, Volume 2'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By the release of [[Version 6 Unix]] (1975), the game had been [[Source port|ported]] to [[Unix]] [[C (programming language)|C]]. An implementation of ''Hunt the Wumpus'' was typically included with [[MBASIC]], Microsoft's BASIC interpreter for CP/M and one of the company's first products. ''Hunt the Wumpus'' was adapted as an early game for the [[Commodore PET]] entitled ''Twonky,'' which was distributed in the late 1970s with ''[[Cursor (magazine)|Cursor Magazine]].'' A version of the game can still be found as part of the bsdgames package on modern [[BSD]] and [[Linux]] operating systems, where it is known as &quot;wump.&quot;

Among the many computers it was ported to is the [[HP-41C]] calculator.&lt;ref name=&quot;librach198102&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n231/mode/2up | title=Hunt the Wumpus with Your HP-41C | work=BYTE | date=February 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Librach, Hank | pages=230, 232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 port of the game for the [[TI-99/4A]] differs quite a bit from the original while retaining the same concept. It is a graphical rather than text-based game, and uses a [[regular grid]] equivalent to a [[torus]] rather than an [[icosahedron]]. In this version, the Wumpus is depicted as a large red head with a pair of legs growing out of its sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/ti-994a/hunt-the-wumpus/screenshots/gameShotId,95676/ Hunt the Wumpus] - TI-99/4A Screenshots on [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Dodecahedron.png|right|150px|thumb|The vertices of a dodecahedron illustrate one common shape of the [[labyrinth]] in the ''Hunt the Wumpus'' game.]]
The original [[text-based game|text-based]] version of ''Hunt the Wumpus'' uses a [[command line]] text interface. A player of the game enters commands to move through the rooms or to shoot &quot;crooked arrows&quot; along a tunnel into one of the adjoining rooms. There are twenty rooms, each connecting to three others, arranged like the vertices of a [[dodecahedron]] or the faces of an [[icosahedron]] (which are identical in layout). Hazards include bottomless pits, super bats (which drop the player in a random location, a feature duplicated in later, commercially published [[adventure game]]s, such as ''[[Zork I]]'', ''[[Valley of the Minotaur]]'', and ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]''), and the Wumpus itself. The Wumpus is described as having sucker feet (to escape the bottomless pits) and being too heavy for a super bat to lift. When the player has deduced from hints which chamber the Wumpus is in without entering the chamber, the player fires an arrow into the Wumpus's chamber to kill it. The player wins the game if the  Wumpus is killed. However, firing the arrow into the wrong chamber startles the Wumpus, which may cause it to move to an adjacent room. The player loses if he or she is in the same room as the Wumpus (which then eats him or her) or a bottomless pit (which he or she then falls into).

=== Game elements ===
Yob's original program had these features, while later programs differ here.
* Objects:
** Wumpus: your target; a beast that eats you if you ever end up in the same room.
** Super Bats (2): creatures that instantly carry you to a random room.
** Pits (2): fatal to you if you enter the room.
* Actions: There are two possible actions:
** Move: to one of the three rooms connected to your current one.
** Shoot: fire a &quot;crooked arrow&quot; a distance of 1-5 rooms; you must name each room it will reach.
* Warning messages: Give you information about the contents of adjacent rooms.
** Wumpus: &quot;I smell a wumpus&quot;
** Bat: &quot;Bats nearby&quot;
** Pit: &quot;I feel a draft&quot;

== Reception and cultural impact==
{{Prose|section|date=March 2016}}

'''Hearst Communications Inc.''', often referred to simply as '''Hearst''', is an American [[mass media]] and [[business information]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] based in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/swartz-succeeds-bennack-as-hearst-ceo-6877092/|title=Hearst’s New CEO Steve Swartz Talks Business, Succession|first=Erik|last=Maza|date=April 1, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hearst owns a wide variety of [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[television channel]]s, and [[television station]]s, including the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', 50% of broadcasting firm [[A&amp;E Networks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/hearst/|title=Hearst family|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 20% of the sports broadcaster [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]]—the last two both co-owned with [[The Walt Disney Company]]. 

Despite being better known for the above media holdings, Hearst makes most of its profits in the business information section, where it owns companies including [[First Databank]], [[Homecare Homebase]], [[MOTOR Information Systems]], 80% of [[Fitch Ratings]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nypost.com/2016/01/05/hearst-enjoys-record-revenue-in-2015-no-thanks-to-magazines/|title=Hearst enjoys record profits, eyes more acquisitions|last=Kelly|first=Keith J.|date=2016-01-06|website=New York Post|access-date=2016-11-04}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Hearst company is based in the [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The company was founded by [[William Randolph Hearst]] as an owner of newspapers, and the Hearst family remains involved in its [[ownership]] and [[management]].

== Trustees of William Randolph Hearst's will ==
Under William Randolph Hearst's will, a common board of thirteen trustees (its composition fixed at five family members and eight outsiders) administers the Hearst Foundation, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the trust that owns (and selects the 24-member board of) the Hearst Corporation(immediate parent of Hearst Communications which shares the same officers). The foundations shared ownership until [[Tax Reform Act of 1969|tax law]] changed to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hearstfdn.org/about/about-hearst-foundations/]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of 2017, the trustees are&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hearst.com/newsroom/mitchell-scherzer-elected-a-trustee-of-the-hearst-family]&lt;/ref&gt;:

=== Family members ===

* Anissa Boudjakdji Balson, granddaughter of fifth son, David Whitmire Hearst Sr.
* Lisa Hearst Hagerman, granddaughter of third son, [[John Randolph Hearst]] Sr.
* [[George Randolph Hearst III]], grandson of Hearst's eldest son, [[George Randolph Hearst]] Sr., and publisher of the ''[[Albany Times Union]]''
* [[William Randolph Hearst III]], son of second son, [[William Randolph Hearst Jr.]], and chairman of the board of the corporation
* Virginia Hearst Randt, daughter of late former chairman and fourth son, [[Randolph Apperson Hearst]]

=== Non-family members ===
* James M. Asher, chief legal and development officer of the corporation
* David J. Barrett, former chief executive officer of Hearst Television, Inc.
* Frank A. Bennack Jr., former chief executive officer and executive vice chairman of the corporation
* John G. Conomikes, former executive of the corporation
* Gilbert C. Maurer, former chief operating officer of the corporation and former president of Hearst Magazines
* Mark F. Miller, former executive vice president of Hearst Magazines
* Mitchell Scherzer, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the corporation
* Steven R. Swartz, president and chief executive officer of the corporation

The trust dissolves when all family members alive at the time of Hearst's death in August 1951 have died.

== History ==
===The formative years===
In 1880, [[George Hearst]] (1820–1891), mining entrepreneur, American publisher, and U.S. senator, entered the newspaper business, acquiring the ''[[San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Daily Examiner]].''

On March 4, 1887, he turned the ''Examiner'' over to his son, 23-year-old [[William Randolph Hearst]]. The newly appointed editor and publisher transformed the sedate ''Examiner'' into &quot;The Monarch of the Dailies&quot;: he acquired the most advanced printing equipment of his day, substantially revised the newspaper’s appearance, and hired the best journalists he could find. He pushed his staff to write exciting news stories, and wrote editorials worded with force and conviction that enlivened the paper. Within a few years, the new ''Examiner'' was a success.

In 1895, Hearst purchased the ''[[New York Journal]],'' laying the foundation for one of the major newspaper dynasties in American history. He established ''[[Chicago Herald-Examiner|Hearst's Chicago American]]'' in 1900, renamed the morning edition of the ''New York Journal'' as the ''New York American'' in 1901. The ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' was launched in 1903 followed by the ''[[Boston American]]'' one year later.

Hearst experimented with every aspect of newspaper publishing, from page layouts to editorial crusades. His newspapers introduced innovations such as multi-color presses, halftone photographs on newsprint, comic sections printed in color, and wire syndication of news copy. Stories by Hearst correspondents from around the world were sold to other newspapers, giving rise to the Hearst [[International News Service]] and the Universal wire service.

In 1903, Hearst Magazines was begun with the publication of ''[[Motor (Hearst magazine)|Motor]]'' magazine. Within the next 10 years Hearst acquired several popular titles, starting in 1905 with ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' in 1911. Also in 1911, Hearst bought a middling monthly magazine called ''World To-Day'', which in April 1912 he renamed ''Hearst's Magazine.'' In June 1914, its title was shortened to ''Hearst's'', and it was ultimately retitled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine which it kept until 1999 when it was sold to [[Robert E. Petersen]].

Hearst began producing film feature in the mid-1910s, creating one of the earliest [[animation studio]]s: the [[International Film Service]]. While the studio folded quickly, Hearst would regularly make film adaptations of his comic strips in collaboration with Hollywood studios until the late 1950s, though most of them have become lost films, as those had to be destroyed after 10 years after their release; a precautionary measure by Hearst in case the films didn't do well, to minimize the impact of any flop on said comic's popularity.

Hearst established Cosmopolitan Pictures in the 1920s, distributing his films under the newly created [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]]. In 1929, Hearst and MGM created the Hearst Metrotone newsreels.

In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged ''Hearst's International'' magazine with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925, calling it ''Hearst's International combined with Cosmopolitan''. The ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of 84 [[Point (typography)|points]], over a 20-year time span, while the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased from 36 points to a barely legible 12 points. Hearst died in 1951, and the ''Hearst's International'' disappeared from the magazine cover altogether in April 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landers |first=James |year=2010 |title=The Improbable First Century of Cosmopolitan Magazine |location=Columbia, Missouri |publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8262-1906-0 |pages=169–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The golden era===
[[Image:HEARST2.JPG|thumb|right|An ad asking automakers to place ads in Hearst chain, noting their circulation.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s, Hearst owned the biggest media conglomerate in the world. Apart from having highly circulated magazines and owning 28 newspapers in 18 major cities from coast to coast (many of them under either the ''American'' or ''Examiner'' banners), read by one out of four Americans each day, Hearst also began acquiring radio stations to complement his papers.

After purchasing the ''[[Atlanta Georgian]]'' in 1912 along with the ''[[San Francisco Call]]'' and the ''San Francisco Post'' in 1913, Hearst acquired the ''[[Boston Advertiser]]'' and the ''Washington Times'' (unrelated to the present-day paper) in 1917, followed by the ''[[Chicago Herald (1914–18)|Chicago Herald]]'' in 1918 (resulting in the ''Herald-Examiner'') and the ''[[Washington Herald]]'' in 1922. Beginning in 1921, the company extended its reach, establishing or acquiring the ''[[Detroit Times]]'', the ''Boston Record'' (turning the ''Advertiser'' into a tabloid), the ''Milwaukee Telegram'' and ''Wisconsin News'', the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' (1921), the ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'', the ''Rochester Journal'' and ''American'', the ''[[Syracuse Telegram]]'' and ''American'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'' (1922), the ''[[Baltimore News]]'' and ''American'', the ''Rochester Post-Express'' (1923), the ''[[San Antonio Light]]'' and the ''[[New York Mirror]]'' (1924). In 1924 he also merged his Milwaukee operations with the Pfister family, owners of ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]''. Hearst owned the evening ''Wisconsin News'' while the Pfisters kept the ''Sentinel'' adding Hearst's features from the now-folded ''Telegram''.

In 1925, Hearst sold the ''Syracuse Telegram'' to the owners of the ''[[Syracuse Journal]]'', while selling the ''New York Mirror'' in 1928. However, he kept overseeing both papers' operations, eventually buying back the ''Daily Mirror'' in 1932. In 1927, Hearst acquired the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', which he switched with associate Paul Block in exchange for the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]''. That same year he also acquired the ''[[Omaha Bee]]'' and ''News''. In 1929, Hearst closed the ''Boston Advertiser'' (becoming the name for the Sunday ''American'' until 1972) and acquired the ''San Francisco Bulletin'' merging it with the ''Call &amp; Post''. In late 1931 he also bought the ''[[Los Angeles Express (newspaper)|Los Angeles Evening Express]]'', forming the ''Herald-Express''. In 1935, the ''Baltimore News'' bought E.W. Scripps' ''Baltimore Post'', creating the ''Baltimore News-Post''.

===Retrenching after the Great Depression===
The [[Great Depression]] hit Hearst hard, forcing him to sell the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' to Eleanor &quot;Cissy&quot; Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'') in 1939 who merged them together into the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' from Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.

Hearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers: the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in Chicago in 1939, and in 1937 the ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''Journal-American'' in New York, the same year the ''Omaha Bee-News'' was sold to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media empire as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold off or shut down.

Afternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.

In 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]].

The earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', had to finance the company's money-losing afternoon publications, among those the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The latter paper was sold in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s owners (who continued and later changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969, and closed it in 1974). Hearst also sold the ''Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph'' (merged with the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'') and the ''Detroit Times'' (merged with the ''Detroit News'') in 1960 and the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' (which merged with the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'') in 1962 after a lengthy strike, the same year Hearst's L.A. papers - the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' - were merged into the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left Manhattan with no papers for many months, which affected the ''Journal-American''. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' were merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American''. In 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.

In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''.

Beginning in 1965, the Hearst Corporation began recurring [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (&quot;JOA&quot;s); the first reached with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner'', which turned into an evening publication, folding the ''News-Call-Bulletin''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald-Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'', thus forming the ''[[New York World Journal Tribune]]'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.

The 1962 merger of the Los Angeles papers had led to the sacking of many journalists who went on to stage a 10-year strike in 1967, which ended up accelerating the pace of the company's sinking.

In 1982, the company sold the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Herald American]]'' (the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's ''Record-American &amp; Advertiser'' with the ''Herald-Traveler''), to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]], which promptly renamed the paper as ''[[The Boston Herald]]'', competing to this day with the ''[[Boston Globe]]'').

In 1986, Hearst bought the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and that year closed the 213-year-old ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'' after a failed attempt to obtain a JOA with the family publishers of ''[[Baltimore Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]'' - [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell|A.S. Abell Company]] -  which coincidentally sold its paper several days later to the [[Tribune Company|Times-Mirror]] syndicate of the Chandlers' ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', also competitor to the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]'', which folded in 1989.

In 1993, the ''San Antonio Light'' was shut down after Hearst purchased its rival, the ''San Antonio Express-News'' from Murdoch.

On November 8, 1990, Hearst Corporation acquired the remaining 20% stake of [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN, Inc.]] from [[RJR Nabisco]] for a price estimated between $165 million and $175 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=GERALDINE FABRIKANT|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/business/hearst-to-buy-20-espn-stake-from-rjr.html |title=Hearst to Buy 20% ESPN Stake From RJ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=November 9, 1990 |accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 80% has been owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] since 1996. Over the last 25 years, the ESPN investment is said to have accounted for at least 50% of total Hearst Corp profits and is worth at least $13 billion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashesandflames.com/2013/12/is-the-worlds-first-media-group-now-the-best/|title=Is the world’s first media group now the best?|work=Flashes &amp; Flames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Hearst Corp. pulled another &quot;switcheroo&quot; by selling its flagship and &quot;Monarch of the Dailies&quot;, the afternoon ''San Francisco Examiner'', and acquiring the long-time competing but now larger morning paper, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' from the [[M.H. de Young|Charles de Young]] family. The ''San Francisco Examiner'' is now published as a daily freesheet.

In December 2003, [[Marvel Entertainment]] acquired ''Cover Concepts'' from Hearst, to extend Marvel's demographic reach among public school children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_Dec_18/ai_111376112 |title=Marvel Acquires Cover Concepts to Extend Demographic Reach; Acquisition Extends Reach of Marvel's Publishing Operations to 30 Million Public School Children |accessdate=May 14, 2008 |work=BNet | date=December 18, 2003}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[A&amp;E Networks]] acquired [[Lifetime Entertainment Services]], with Hearst ownership increasing to 42%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007820.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=A&amp;E Acquires Lifetime]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date= August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/329151-A_E_Networks_Lifetime_Merger_Completed.php |title=A&amp;E Networks, Lifetime Merger Completed|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media|NewBay Media LLC]]|date= August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' switched to a digital-only format, leaving the ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'' as the only remaining Hearst paper from its golden age still owned by the company.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In 2010, Hearst acquired digital marketing agency iCrossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/google-and-hearst-make-digital-acquisitions/ |title=Google and Hearst Make Digital Acquisitions |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |date=June 3, 2010 |work=Media Decoder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hearst absorbed more than 100 magazine titles from the [[Lagardère Group|Lagardere]] group for more than $700 million and became a challenger of [[Time Inc]] ahead of [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]]. In December 2012, Hearst Corporation partnered again with [[NBCUniversal]] to launch [[Esquire Network]].

On February 20, 2014, Hearst Magazines International appointed Gary Ellis to the new position, Chief Digital Officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hearst Magazines International Makes Digital Hire&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/hearst-magazines-international-makes-digital-hire-7491274 | title=Hearst Magazines International Makes Digital Hire | publisher=WWD | date=February 20, 2014 | accessdate=February 24, 2014 | author=Steigrad,  Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That December, [[DreamWorks Animation]] sold a 25% stake in [[AwesomenessTV (company)|AwesomenessTV]] for $81.25 million to Hearst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verrier|first1=Richard|title=Hearst Corp. buys 25% stake in AwesomenessTV|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dreamworks-hearst-20141211-story.html|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times Media Group|date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Hearst announced that it had acquired a majority stake in [[Litton Entertainment]]. Its CEO, Dave Morgan, was a former employee of Hearst.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvspy-hearstlitton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hearst Invests in Media Entertainment Production Company|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/hearst-invests-in-media-entertainment-production-company/183796|website=TVSpy|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearst Acquires Majority Stake in Independent Distributor Litton Entertainment|url=http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hearst-entertainment-litton-acquires-syndication-1201954104/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2017, Hearst announced that it has acquired the business operations of The Pioneer Group from fourth-generation family owners Jack and John Batdorff. The Pioneer Group was a Michigan-based communications network that circulates print and digital news to local communities across the state. In addition to daily newspapers, ''The Pioneer'' and ''Manistee News Advocate'', Pioneer published three weekly papers and four local shopper publications, and operates a digital marketing services business. The acquisition brought Hearst Newspapers to publishing 19 daily and 61 weekly papers.

Other 2017 acquisitions include the [[New Haven Register]] and associated papers from [[Digital First Media]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-acquires-print-digital-and-local-media-assets-of-21st-century- media-newspaper-llc-including-the-new-haven-register Hearst Acquires Print,Digital,and Local Media Assets of 21st Century Media Newspaper LLC,Including the New Haven Register]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courant.com/business/hc-hearst-acquisitions-20170605-story.html Hearst Acquires New Haven Register,Other Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Alton, Illinois]], ''[[The Telegraph (Alton, Illinois)|Telegraph]]'' and [[Jacksonville, Illinois]], ''[[Journal-Courier]]'' from [[Civitas Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hearst.com/newsroom/hearst-acquires-the-print-and-digital-assets-of-the-telegraph-and-journal-courier Hearst Acquires the Print and Digital Assets of the Telegraph and Journal-Courier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/113333/hearst-acquires-journal-courier-telegraph Hearst Acquires Journal-Courier,Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hunter Stockton Thompson''' (July 18, 1937 – February 20, 2005) was an American journalist and author, and the founder of the [[gonzo journalism]] movement. Born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to a middle-class family, Thompson had a turbulent youth after the death of his father left the family in poverty. He was unable to formally finish high school as he was incarcerated for 60 days after abetting a robbery. He subsequently joined the [[United States Air Force]] before moving into journalism. He traveled frequently, including stints in California, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, before settling in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in the early 1960s.

Thompson became internationally known with the publication of ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' (1967). For his research on the book he had spent a year living and riding with the Angels, experiencing their lives and hearing their stories first-hand. Previously a relatively conventional journalist, with the publication in 1970 of ''[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]'' he became a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counter cultural]] figure, with his own brand of [[New Journalism]] which he termed &quot;Gonzo&quot;, an experimental style of journalism where reporters involve themselves in the action to such a degree that they become central figures of their stories. The work he remains best known for, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream]]'' (1971), constitutes a rumination on the failure of the [[1960s counterculture]] movement. It was first serialized in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', a magazine with which Thompson would be long associated, and was adapted into a [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|film]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] and directed by [[Terry Gilliam]] in 1998.

Politically minded, Thompson ran unsuccessfully for [[sheriff]] of [[Pitkin County, Colorado]], in 1970, on the Freak Power ticket. He became well known for his inveterate hatred of [[Richard Nixon]], who he claimed represented &quot;that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Hunter S Thompson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4283349.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whom he characterized in ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''. Thompson's output notably declined from the mid-1970s, as he struggled with the consequences of fame, and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized. He was also known for his lifelong use of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and illegal drugs, his love of [[firearm]]s, and his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] contempt for [[authoritarianism]]. He remarked: &quot;I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.&quot;

After a bout of health problems, Thompson committed suicide at the age of 67. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired out of a cannon in a ceremony funded by his friend Depp and attended by friends including then-Senator [[John Kerry]] and [[Jack Nicholson]]. [[Hari Kunzru]] wrote that &quot;the true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist&amp;nbsp;... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n20/hari-kunzru/the-first-person-steroid-enhanced |title=Hari Kunzru reviews 'The Rum Diary' by Hunter S.

==Early life==
Thompson was born into a middle-class family in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the first of three sons of Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893, [[Horse Cave, Kentucky]] – July 3, 1952, Louisville), a [[Public Insurance Adjusting|public insurance adjuster]] and [[World War I]] veteran, and of Virginia Ray Davison (1908, [[Springfield, Kentucky]] – March 20, 1998, Louisville), who worked as head librarian at the [[Louisville Free Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Reitwiesner|first= William Addams|title= Ancestry of Hunter Thompson|url= http://www.wargs.com/other/thompson.html|accessdate= August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the [[University of Kentucky]] in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Whitmer | first= Peter O.| authorlink= | year= 1993 | title = When The Going Gets Weird: The Twisted Life and Times of Hunter S.

On December 2, 1943, when Thompson was six years old, the family settled at 2437 Ransdell Avenue in the affluent [[Cherokee Triangle, Louisville|Cherokee Triangle]] neighborhood of [[The Highlands (Louisville)|The Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Eblen|first= Tom|title= For sale: Hunter S.

Hunter also had a much older half-brother, James Thompson, Jr., from his father's first marriage, who was not part of the Thompson household. Virginia worked as a librarian to support her children, and is described as having become a &quot;heavy drinker&quot; following her husband's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Hunter S Thompson Biography and Notes |url= http://www.biblio.com/hunter-s-thompson~142810~author |title= Books by Hunter S.

===Education===
Interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age, Thompson co-founded the Hawks Athletic Club while attending [[Public schools in Louisville, Kentucky#Elementary Schools|I.N. Bloom Elementary School]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HawksClub&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Outlaw Journalist: The Life and Times of Hunter S. Thompson|isbn= 978-0393061925|author= [[William McKeen]]|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year= 2008|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to an invitation to join Louisville's Castlewood Athletic Club,&lt;ref name=&quot;HawksClub&quot;/&gt; a club for adolescents that prepared them for [[Amateur sports|high-school sports]]. Ultimately he never joined any sports teams in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmer&quot;/&gt;

Thompson attended I.N. Bloom Elementary School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Outlaw Journalist|isbn= |author= McKeen|year= 2008|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Highland Middle School (Louisville, Kentucky)|Highland Middle School]], and [[Atherton High School]], before transferring to [[Louisville Male High School]] in September 1952. Also in 1952, he was accepted as a member of the Athenaeum [[Literary society|Literary Association]], a school-sponsored literary and social club that dated to 1862. Its members at the time, generally drawn from Louisville's wealthy [[American upper class|upper-class]] families, included [[Porter Bibb]], who became the first publisher of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. During this time Thompson read and admired [[J. P. Donleavy]]'s ''[[The Ginger Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries|title=Obituary: Hunter S. Thompson: Colourful chronicler of American life whose 'gonzo' journalism contrived to put him always at the centre of the action|author=Eric Homberger|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=February 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an Athenaeum member, Thompson contributed articles to and helped produce the club's [[yearbook]] ''The Spectator''. The group ejected Thompson in 1955, citing his legal problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmer&quot;/&gt; Charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to robbery after being in a car with the perpetrator, Thompson was sentenced to 60 days in Kentucky's [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] Jail. He served 31 days and, a week after his release, enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmer&quot;/&gt; While he was in jail, the school [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]] refused him permission to take his high-school final examinations, and as a result he did not graduate.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

===Military service===
Thompson completed [[Recruit training|basic training]] at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and transferred to [[Scott Air Force Base]] in [[Belleville, Illinois]], to study [[electronics]]. He applied to become an aviator, but the Air Force's [[Military aviation|aviation]]-[[cadet]] program rejected his application. In 1956, he transferred to [[Eglin Air Force Base]] near [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]]. While serving at Eglin, he took evening classes at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Thompson, Hunter S.|url= http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-03546.html|work= American National Biography Online|accessdate= August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Eglin, he landed his first professional writing job as [[Sports Journalism|sports editor]] of ''The Command Courier'' by lying about his job experience. As sports editor, Thompson traveled around the United States with the Eglin Eagles [[American football|football]] team, covering its games. In early 1957 he wrote a sports column for ''[[Northwest Florida Daily News|The Playground News]]'', a local newspaper in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]]. He could not use his name on the column because the Air Force did not allow airmen to hold other jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmer&quot;/&gt;

Thompson was discharged from the Air Force in November 1957 as an [[Airman First Class]], his commanding officer having recommended him for an early [[honorable discharge]]. &quot;In summary, this airman, although talented, will not be guided by policy&quot;, Col. William S. Evans, chief of information services wrote to the Eglin personnel office. &quot;Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airmen staff members.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

===Early journalism career===
After the Air Force, Thompson worked as sports editor for a newspaper in [[Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=&quot;songsdoomed&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Thompson | first= Hunter | year= 2002 | title= Songs of the Doomed | edition= Reprint|publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | isbn= 0-7432-4099-5 | pages = 29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; before relocating to New York City. There he audited several courses at the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]]. During this time he worked briefly for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as a [[copy boy]] for $51 a week. While working, he used a typewriter to copy [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' in order to learn about the writing styles of the authors. In 1959 ''Time'' fired him for [[insubordination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;proudway&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Thompson | first= Hunter | editor = Douglas Brinkley | year= 1998 | title= The Proud Highway: Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman | edition= 1st|publisher= [[Ballantine Books]] | isbn= 0-345-37796-6 | page = 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he worked as a reporter for ''[[Times Herald-Record|The Middletown Daily Record]]'' in [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]], New York. He was fired from this job after damaging an office [[Vending machine|candy machine]] and arguing with the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudway&quot;/&gt;

In 1960, Thompson moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], to take a job with the sporting magazine ''El Sportivo'', which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rican English-language daily ''[[The San Juan Star]]'', but its managing editor, future novelist [[William J. Kennedy]], turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends, and after the demise of ''El Sportivo'', Thompson worked as a [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and for a few stateside papers on Caribbean issues, with Kennedy working as his editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hunter S.

While there, he published his first magazine feature in the nationally distributed ''[[Rogue (magazine)|Rogue]]'' magazine, on the [[artisan]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture of Big Sur. Thompson had had a rocky tenure as caretaker of the hot springs, and the unexpected publicity from the article finally got him fired. During this period, Thompson wrote two novels, ''[[Prince Jellyfish]]'' and ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'', and submitted many [[short story|short stories]] to publishers - with little success. ''The Rum Diary'', a novel based on Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico, was eventually published in {{Not a typo|1998}}.

From May 1962 to May 1963, Thompson traveled to South America as a correspondent for a [[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]]-owned weekly newspaper, the ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/hunter-s-thompsons-pre-gonzo-journalism-surprisingly-earnest/361355/|title=Before Gonzo: Hunter S. Thompson's Early, Underrated Journalism Career|last=Kevin|first=Brian|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]] he spent several months as a reporter for the ''Brazil Herald'', the country's only English-language [[Newspaper#Types|daily]], published in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. His longtime girlfriend Sandra Dawn Conklin (a.k.a. Sandy Conklin Thompson, now Sondi Wright) later joined him in Rio. They married on May 19, 1963, shortly after returning to the United States, and lived briefly in [[Aspen, Colorado]], where they had a son, Juan Fitzgerald Thompson (born March 23, 1964). The couple conceived five more times, but three pregnancies were [[miscarriage|miscarried]], and the other two produced infants who died shortly after birth. Hunter and Sandy divorced in 1980 but always remained close friends.

In 1964 the family relocated to [[Glen Ellen, California]], where Thompson continued to write for the ''National Observer'' on an array of domestic subjects. One story told of his 1964 visit to [[Ketchum, Idaho]], to investigate the reasons for [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[Ernest Hemingway#Idaho and suicide|suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Brinkley|first= Douglas|title= The Final Days at Owl Farm|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7092353/the_final_days_at_owl_farm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071018060554/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7092353/the_final_days_at_owl_farm|archivedate= October 18, 2007|work= Rolling Stone|accessdate= August 3, 2012|date= March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he stole a pair of [[elk]] antlers hanging above the front door of Hemingway's cabin. Thompson severed his ties with the ''Observer'' after his editor refused to print his review of [[Tom Wolfe]]'s 1965 essay collection ''[[The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Douglas or Sadler, Shelby. {{cite book |last= Thompson |first= Hunter |editor = Douglas Brinkley |year= 2000 |title = Fear and Loathing in America |edition= 1st |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn= 0-684-87315-X |page = 784}} Introduction to letter to Tom Wolfe, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to San Francisco. He immersed himself in the [[drug culture|drug]] and [[hippie|hippie culture]] that was [[History of San Francisco#&quot;Summer of Love&quot; and counterculture movement|taking root in the area]], and soon began writing for the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] [[Underground press|underground paper]] ''Spider''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Louison|first= Cole|title= This is skag folks, pure skag: Hunter Thompson|url= http://www.ithaca.edu/buzzsaw/archive_skag.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903032602/http://www.ithaca.edu/buzzsaw/archive_skag.htm|archivedate= September 3, 2006|work= Buzzsaw Haircut|publisher= Ithaca.edu|accessdate= August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hell's Angels''===
{{See also|Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs}}
In 1965 [[Carey McWilliams (journalist)|Carey McWilliams]], editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', hired Thompson to write a story about the [[Hells Angels]]{{ref|a|*}} [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle club]] in California. The article appeared on May 17, 1965, and after that Thompson received several book offers and spent the next year living and riding with the club. The relationship broke down when the bikers perceived that Thompson was exploiting them for personal gain and demanded a share of the profits from his writings. An argument at a party resulted in Thompson suffering a savage beating (or &quot;stomping&quot;, as the Angels referred to it). [[Random House]] published the hard-cover ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' in 1966, and the fight between Thompson and the Angels was well-marketed. [[CBC Television]] even broadcast an encounter between Thompson and Hells Angel Skip Workman before a live studio audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= RetroBites: Hunter S. Thompson &amp; Hell's Angels (1967)|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccyu44rsaZo|work= Youtube|publisher= CBC|accessdate= August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer for ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the work as an &quot;angry, knowledgeable, fascinating and excitedly written book&quot;, that shows the Hells Angels &quot;not so much as dropouts from society but as total misfits, or unfits&amp;nbsp;— emotionally, intellectually and educationally unfit to achieve the rewards, such as they are, that the contemporary [[social order]] offers&quot;. The reviewer also praised Thompson as a &quot;spirited, witty, observant and original writer; his [[prose]] crackles like motorcycle exhaust&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;

==Late 1960s==
Following the success of ''Hell's Angels'', Thompson was able to publish articles in a number of well-known magazines during the late 1960s, including ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Pageant (magazine)|Pageant]]'', and ''[[Harper's]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hunter-S-Thompson#ref837474|title=Hunter S. Thompson {{!}} American journalist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Times Magazine'' article, published in 1967, shortly before the &quot;[[Summer of Love]]&quot;, and titled &quot;The Hashbury is the Capital of the Hippies&quot;, Thompson wrote in-depth about the [[History of the hippie movement|Hippies]] of San Francisco, deriding a culture that began to lack the political convictions of the [[New Left]] and the artistic core of the [[beat generation|Beats]], instead becoming overrun with newcomers lacking any purpose other than obtaining [[Psychedelic drug|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Hunter S. &quot;The Hashbury Is the Capital of the Hippie&quot;, ''The New York Times Magazine'', May 17, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an observation on [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the 1960s' counterculture]] that Thompson would further examine in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' and other articles.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, David S., &quot;[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=2688 Hell's Angels: The Precursor to Gonzo]&quot;, ''Beatdom Literary Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1967, Thompson and his family moved back to Colorado and rented a house in [[Woody Creek, Colorado|Woody Creek]], a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson finally received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of ''Hell's Angels'' and used two-thirds of the money for a [[down payment]] on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=2006 | title= Fear and Loathing in America | edition=Paperback | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | isbn=978-0-684-87316-9 | page = 784}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named the house Owl Farm and often described it as his &quot;fortified compound.&quot;

In early 1968, Thompson signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot;, ''New York Post'', January 30, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thompson's letters and his later writings, at this time he planned to write a book called ''The Joint Chiefs'' about &quot;the death of the [[American Dream]].&quot; He used a $6,000 advance from [[Random House]] to travel on the 1968 Presidential campaign trail and attend the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago for research purposes. From his hotel room in Chicago, Thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters, which he wrote had a great effect on his political views. The book was never finished, and the theme of the death of the American dream would be carried over into his later work. The contract with Random House was eventually fulfilled with the 1972 book ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 2001 784&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=2001 | title= Fear and Loathing in America | edition=2nd | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | isbn=978-0-684-87316-9 | page = 784}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also signed a deal with [[Ballantine Books]] in 1968 to write a satirical book called ''The Johnson File'' about [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. A few weeks after the contract was signed, however, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election, and the deal was cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 2001 784&quot;/&gt;

==Middle years==
{{See also|The Battle of Aspen}}
[[File:Thompson_for_Sheriff_poster.jpg|thumb|right|Thompson for Sheriff]]
In 1970, Thompson ran for [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of [[Pitkin County, Colorado]], as part of a group of citizens running for local offices on the [[The Battle of Aspen|&quot;Freak Power&quot;]] ticket. The platform included promoting the [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization of drugs]] (for personal use only, not trafficking, as he disapproved of [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]]), tearing up the streets and turning them into grassy [[pedestrian mall]]s, banning any building so tall as to obscure the view of the mountains, and renaming Aspen &quot;Fat City&quot; to deter investors. Thompson, having shaved his head, referred to the [[crew cut]]-wearing [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate as &quot;my [[hippy|long-haired]] opponent.&quot;

With polls showing him with a slight lead in a three-way race, Thompson appeared at ''Rolling Stone'' magazine headquarters in San Francisco with a six-pack of beer in hand, and declared to editor [[Jann Wenner]] that he was about to be elected Sheriff of Aspen, Colorado, and wished to write about the &quot;Freak Power&quot; movement.&lt;ref name=interviews1976&gt;{{Citation |title= Rolling Stone, Part 2; Hunter Thompson Meets Fear and Loathing Face to Face |magazine=[[New Times (magazine)|New Times]] |date=December 10, 1970 |last=Anson |first= Robert Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Thompson's first article in ''Rolling Stone'' was published as ''[[The Battle of Aspen]]'' with the byline &quot;By: Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (Candidate for Sheriff).&quot; Despite the publicity, Thompson narrowly lost the election. While carrying the city of Aspen, he garnered only 44% of the county-wide vote in what had become a two-way race. The Republican candidate agreed to withdraw a few days before the election in order to consolidate the anti-Thompson votes, in return for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] withdrawing their candidate for county commissioner. Thompson later remarked that the ''Rolling Stone'' article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter S. Thompson (2003), ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'', Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of Gonzo===
{{Main article|Gonzo journalism}}
Also in 1970, Thompson wrote an article entitled ''[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]'' for the short-lived [[new journalism]] magazine ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]''. For that article, editor [[Warren Hinckle]] paired Thompson with illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]], who drew [[expressionism|expressionist]] illustrations with lipstick and eyeliner. Thompson and Steadman collaborated regularly after that. Although it was not widely read, the article was the first to use the techniques of [[Gonzo journalism]], a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic [[First-person narrative|first-person]] subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook. 

The first use of the word &quot;Gonzo&quot; to describe Thompson's work is credited to the journalist [[Bill Cardoso]]. Cardoso first met Thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the [[New Hampshire primary#1968|1968 New Hampshire primary]]. In 1970, Cardoso (who was then the editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]] Sunday Magazine'') wrote to Thompson praising the ''Kentucky Derby'' piece as a breakthrough: &quot;This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling.&quot; According to Steadman, Thompson took to the word right away and said, &quot;Okay, that's what I do. Gonzo.&quot;&lt;ref name=cardoso-obit&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Bill Cardoso, 68, Editor Who Coined 'Gonzo', Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/national/16cardoso.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=c7b5fe5f62a5d95e&amp;ex=1300165200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson's first published use of the word appears in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'': &quot;Free Enterprise.

{{Main article|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas}}
The book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for ''[[Strange Rumblings in Aztlan]]'', an exposé for ''Rolling Stone'' on the 1970 killing of the [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] television journalist [[Rubén Salazar]]. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] during the [[Chicano Moratorium|National Chicano Moratorium March]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. One of Thompson's sources for the story was [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to write a 250-word photograph caption on the [[Mint 400]] motorcycle race held there.

What was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to ''Sports Illustrated'' a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, &quot;aggressively rejected.&quot; ''Rolling Stone'' publisher [[Jann Wenner]] was said to have liked &quot;the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication&amp;nbsp;— which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it&quot;, Thompson later wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=1979 | title= The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time | edition=1st | publisher=[[Summit Books]] | isbn=0-671-40046-0 | pages = 105–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of ''Rolling Stone'' as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named [[Raoul Duke]] on a trip to Las Vegas with [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]], his &quot;300-pound [[Samoans|Samoan]] attorney&quot;, to cover a [[Prohibition (drugs)|narcotics officers]]' convention and the &quot;fabulous Mint 400&quot;. During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as &quot;my attorney&quot;) become sidetracked by a search for the [[American Dream]], with &quot;two bags of [[cannabis (drug)|grass]], seventy-five pellets of [[mescaline]], five sheets of high-powered [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|blotter acid]], a salt shaker half full of [[cocaine]], and a whole galaxy of multi-colored [[Amphetamine|uppers]], [[Barbiturates|downers]], [[Methamphetamine|screamers]], [[Nitrous Oxide|laughers]]&amp;nbsp;... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw [[Diethyl ether|ether]], and two dozen [[amyl nitrite|amyls]].&quot;

Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s [[counterculture|countercultural movement]] is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as &quot;by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Crawford|title='Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/books/thompson-1972-vegar.html|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 23, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Vegas Book&quot;, as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.

===''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72''===
{{Main article|Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72}}
Beginning in late 1971 Thompson wrote extensively for ''Rolling Stone'' on [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|election campaigns]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator [[George McGovern]]. The articles were soon combined and published as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''. As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling the &quot;campaign trail&quot;, focusing largely on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s primaries - Nixon, as the Republican incumbent, performed little campaign work - in which McGovern competed with rival candidates [[Edmund Muskie]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Thompson was an early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read ''Rolling Stone''.

Thompson went on to become a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson described him in ''Rolling Stone'' as a man who &quot;could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time&quot; and said &quot;his casket [should] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [He] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the [[Devil]] can understand it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Hunter S. (June 15, 1994) [http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latest-news/he-was-a-crook-hunter-s-thompson-on-the-death-of-richard-nixon &quot;'He was a crook'; Hunter S. Thompson on the death of Richard Nixon&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007203825/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latest-news/he-was-a-crook-hunter-s-thompson-on-the-death-of-richard-nixon |date=October 7, 2013 }}, ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While ''The Washington Post'' was lamenting Nixon's &quot;lonely and depressed&quot; state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that '[i]f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [Nixon's] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Hunter S. |title=Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson |year=2011 |page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.

==Later years==
According to Jann Wenner, co-founder and publisher of ''Rolling Stone'', Thompson's journalistic work began to seriously suffer after his trip to Africa to cover &quot;[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]&quot;—the world heavyweight boxing match between [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]—in 1974. He missed the match while intoxicated at his hotel, and did not submit a story to the magazine. Wenner is quoted by the film critic Roger Ebert as saying in the 2008 documentary of Thompson's life, ''Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson'', &quot;After Africa he just couldn't write. He couldn't piece it together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson-2008|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson was to provide ''Rolling Stone'' with coverage for the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential campaign]] that would appear in a book published by the magazine. Reportedly, as Thompson was waiting for a $75,000 advance check to arrive, he learned that ''Rolling Stone'' publisher Jann Wenner had cancelled the assignment without informing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;interviews1976&quot;/&gt; Wenner then asked Thompson to travel to Vietnam to report on what appeared to be the closing of the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson accepted, and left for [[Saigon]] immediately. He arrived with the country in chaos, just as [[Fall of Saigon|South Vietnam was collapsing]] and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region. While there, Thompson learned that Wenner had pulled the plug on this excursion as well, and Thompson found himself in Vietnam without health insurance or additional financial support. Thompson's story about the fall of Saigon would not be published in ''Rolling Stone'' until ten years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;interviews1976&quot;/&gt; These two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine, and Thompson contributed far less to the publication in later years.

By the late 1970s, Thompson had received complaints from critics, fans and friends that he was regurgitating his past glories without much new on his part;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.gonzo.org/hst/interviews.asp?ID=10 |title=The Great Thompson Hunt&amp;nbsp;— HST &amp; Friends&amp;nbsp;— Rolling Stone College Papers 1980 |publisher=Gonzo.org |date=April 14, 1999 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; these concerns are alluded to in the introduction of ''[[The Great Shark Hunt]]'', where Thompson suggested that his &quot;old self&quot; committed suicide.

The majority of Thompson's literary output after the late 1970s took the form of a four-volume series of books called ''[[The Gonzo Papers]]''. Beginning with ''The Great Shark Hunt'' in 1979 and ending with ''[[Better Than Sex (book)|Better Than Sex]]'' in 1994, the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pre-gonzo period, along with almost all of his ''Rolling Stone'' short pieces, excerpts from the ''Fear and Loathing'' books, and so on.

Perhaps in response to this, as well as the strained relationship with ''Rolling Stone'', and the failure of his marriage, Thompson became more reclusive after 1980. He would often retreat to his compound in Woody Creek and reject assignments or refuse to complete them. Despite the dearth of new material, Wenner kept Thompson on the ''Rolling Stone'' [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] as chief of the &quot;National Affairs Desk&quot;, a position he would hold until his death.

In addition to his divorce from Sandra Conklin, 1980 marked the release of ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'', a loose film adaptation of situations from Thompson's early 1970s work, with [[Bill Murray]] starring as the author. Murray would go on to become one of Thompson's trusted friends. After the lukewarm reception of the film, Thompson temporarily relocated to [[Hawaii]] to work on a book, ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', a Gonzo-style account of a marathon held in that state. Extensively illustrated by [[Ralph Steadman]], the piece first appeared in ''Running'' magazine in 1981 as &quot;The Charge of the Weird Brigade&quot; and was excerpted in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gonzo.org/books/cl/ |title=The Great Thompson Hunt&amp;nbsp;— Books&amp;nbsp;— The Curse of Lono |publisher=Gonzo.org |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 1981, in Aspen, Colorado, Thompson was pulled over at 2am for running a stop sign, and began to &quot;rave&quot; at a state trooper. Consequently, he was arrested, but the drunk-driving charges against him were later dropped.

In 1983, he covered the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of Grenada]] but would not discuss these experiences until the publication of ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'' 20 years later. Later that year, at the behest of [[Terry McDonell]], he authored a piece for ''Rolling Stone'' called &quot;A Dog Took My Place,&quot; an exposé of the scandalous [[Roxanne Pulitzer]] divorce and what he termed the &quot;[[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] lifestyle.&quot; The article contained dubious insinuations of [[bestiality]] (among other things) but was considered to be a return to proper form by many. Shortly thereafter, Thompson accepted an advance to write about &quot;couples pornography&quot; for ''Playboy''. As part of his research, in the spring of 1985 he spent evenings at the [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] [[striptease club]] in San Francisco and his experience there eventually evolved into a full-length novel tentatively titled ''The Night Manager.'' Neither the novel nor the article has been published.

[[File:Hst-by-rsexton-longbeach-5-1989-2.jpg|thumb|alt=Hunter S. Thompson speaking at Bogart's night club in Long Beach, California|Hunter S. Thompson, May 1989.]]

Shortly thereafter, Thompson became a media critic for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', writing a weekly syndicated column for the newspaper in the mid-to-late 1980s. The position was arranged by old friend and fellow ''Examiner'' columnist [[Warren Hinckle]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/HUNTER-S-THOMPSON-1937-2005-Original-gonzo-2728840.php&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson's editor at the ''Examiner'', David McCumber (who would go on to write a [[Mitchell brothers]] biography not long after Jim Mitchell fatally shot his brother Art in 1991), has ruminated on the erratic quality of Thompson's writing by this juncture, opining that &quot;one week it would be acid-soaked gibberish with a charm of its own. The next week it would be incisive political analysis of the highest order...&quot; Many of these columns were published in ''[[Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s]]'' (1988) and ''[[Gonzo Papers, Vol. 3: Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream]]'' (1990; a bricolage of autobiographical reminiscences, recent articles and previously unpublished material).

In 1990, former porn director [[Gail Palmer]] visited Thompson's home in Woody Creek. She later accused him of sexual assault, claiming that he twisted her breast when she refused to join him in the hot tub. She also described cocaine use to authorities. A six-person, 11-hour search of Thompson's home turned up various kinds of drugs and a few sticks of [[dynamite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Dirk|title=Aspen Journal; New Fear and Loathing: Gonzo Writer on Trial|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/22/us/aspen-journal-new-fear-and-loathing-gonzo-writer-on-trial.html|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 22, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; All charges were dismissed after a pre-trial hearing. Thompson would later describe this experience at length in ''Kingdom of Fear''.

By the early 1990s, Thompson was said to be working on a novel called ''[[Polo Is My Life]]'', which was briefly excerpted in ''Rolling Stone'' in 1994, and which Thompson himself described in 1996 as &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a sex book&amp;nbsp;— you know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. It's about the manager of a sex theater who's forced to leave and flee to the mountains. He falls in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in the sex theater in [[San Francisco]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fargone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=T.|first=Marlene|title=Transcript of Hunter S. Thompson Interview|url=http://www.fargonebooks.com/hunter.html|work=The Book Report|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was slated to be released by [[Random House]] in 1999, and was even assigned {{ISBN|0-679-40694-8}}, but was not published.

Thompson continued to publish irregularly in ''Rolling Stone'', ultimately contributing to seventeen pieces in the magazine between 1984 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;https://hstbooks.org/articles-by-hst/hst-rolling-stone/&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Fear and Loathing in Elko,&quot; published in 1992, was a well-received fictional rallying cry against [[Clarence Thomas]], while &quot;Trapped in Mr. Bill's Neighborhood&quot; was a largely non-fictional account of an interview with [[Bill Clinton]] at a [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] steakhouse. Rather than embarking on the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections, Thompson monitored the proceedings from cable television; ''Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie'', his account of the [[1992 Presidential Election|1992 presidential election]] campaign, is composed of reactionary faxes sent to ''Rolling Stone''. In 1994, the magazine published &quot;He Was a Crook,&quot; Thompson's &quot;scathing&quot; obituary of Richard Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' published his final magazine feature (&quot;The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004&quot;), a brief account of the 2004 presidential election in which he compared the outcome of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' to the [[Reichstag fire]] and formally endorsed [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], a longstanding friend.

Thompson was named a [[Kentucky colonel]] by the Governor of [[Kentucky]] in a December 1996 tribute ceremony where he also received keys to the city of Louisville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitehead, Ron|title=''Hunter S. Thompson, Kentucky Colonel''|work=Reykjaviks Magazine|date=March 11, 2005|url=http://www.grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Hunter-S-Thompson-1937-2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612002816/http://www.grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Hunter-S-Thompson-1937-2005|archivedate=June 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fear and Loathing'' redux===
Thompson's work was popularized again with the 1998 release of the film ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', which opened to considerable fanfare. The book was reprinted to coincide with the film, and Thompson's work was introduced to a new generation of readers. Soon thereafter, his &quot;long lost&quot; novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was published, as were the first two volumes of his [[#Letters|collected letters]], which were greeted with critical acclaim.

In July 2000, Thompson accidentally shot his assistant, Deborah Fuller, while attempting to scare a bear away from her lodging on The Owl Farm. He fired a shotgun at the ground near the bear, and the pellets ricocheted upward, hitting her in the right arm and leg. She was quoted as saying &quot;I screamed 'You son of a bitch, you shot me.' And poor Hunter. I don't think I had ever seen him run so fast. He felt horrible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Cowan. ''Hunter S. Thompson: An Insider's View of Deranged, Depraved, Drugged Out Brilliance. ''p. 133. {{ISBN|1599213575}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges were filed for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Ex-assistant sues Hunter Thompson estate for $100,000 in wages |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date= June 28, 2006 |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-06-28-thompson-sued_x.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's next, and penultimate, collection, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child In the Final Days of the American Century]]'', was widely publicized as Thompson's first memoir; in practice, the text combined new material (including reminiscences of the O'Farrell Theater), selected newspaper and digital clippings, and other older works in the expected fashion. Released in 2003, it was perceived by critics to be an angry, vitriolic commentary on the passing of the [[American Century]], and the state of affairs after the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Thompson completed his journalism career in the same way it had begun: writing about sports. From 2000 until his death in 2005, he penned a weekly column called &quot;Hey, Rube&quot; for [[ESPN]].com's [[Page 2]]. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] bundled many of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid-2004 as ''[[Hey Rube (book)|Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness]]''.

Thompson married assistant Anita Bejmuk on April 23, 2003.

==Death==
Thompson died from a [[suicide|self-inflicted]] gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his &quot;fortified compound&quot; in [[Woody Creek, Colorado]], at 5:42&amp;nbsp;p.m. on February 20, 2005. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the ''Aspen Daily News'', Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body. According to the police report and Anita's cell phone records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combined Records Department—Law Incident Table|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/citizen-thompson|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=March 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; he called the sheriff's department half an hour later, then walked outside and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to &quot;mark the passing of his father&quot;. The police report stated that in Thompson's typewriter was a piece of paper with the date “Feb. 22 ‘05” and a single word, &quot;counselor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Citizen Thompson&amp;nbsp;— Police report of death scene reveals gonzo journalist's &quot;rosebud&quot;  | url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/citizen-thompson | publisher = [[The Smoking Gun]] | date = September 8, 2005 | accessdate = October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's inner circle told the press that he had been depressed and always found February a &quot;gloomy&quot; month, with football season over and the harsh Colorado winter weather. He was also upset over his advancing age and chronic medical problems, including a hip replacement; he would frequently mutter &quot;This kid is getting old.&quot; ''Rolling Stone'' published what Doug Brinkley described as a [[suicide note]] written by Thompson to his wife, titled &quot;Football Season Is Over&quot;. It read:

: &quot;No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun&amp;nbsp;— for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your (old) age. Relax&amp;nbsp;— This won't hurt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Football Season Is Over Dr. Hunter S.

Thompson's collaborator and friend [[Ralph Steadman]] wrote:

: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;He told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment. I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. I think that the truth of what rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said. If that is entertainment to you, well, that's OK. If you think that it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell, rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one [[Richard Nixon|Richard Milhous Nixon]] went to&amp;nbsp;— and go there.

===Funeral===
On August 20, 2005, in a private funeral, Thompson's ashes were fired from a cannon. This was accompanied by red, white, blue and green fireworks—all to the tune of [[Norman Greenbaum]]'s &quot;[[Spirit in the Sky]]&quot; and [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;editorandpublisher1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/hot-product-1001018730.story#/news/hot-product-1001018730.story |title=Hunter Thompson Blown Sky High |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610100530/http://www.billboard.com/news/hot-product-1001018730.story |archivedate=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon was placed atop a {{convert|153|ft|m|sing=on}} tower which had the shape of a [[:File:Gonzo.svg|double-thumbed fist clutching a peyote button]], a symbol originally used in his 1970 campaign for Sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado. The plans for the monument were initially drawn by Thompson and Steadman, and were shown as part of an ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' program on the [[BBC]] titled ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood|Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision]]'' (1978). It is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2004 [[Criterion Collection]] DVD release of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', and labeled as ''Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood''.

According to his widow, Anita, the $3 million funeral was funded by actor [[Johnny Depp]], who was a close friend of Thompson. Depp told the ''[[Associated Press]]'', &quot;All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;editorandpublisher1&quot;/&gt; An estimated 280 people attended, including [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] John Kerry&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;&gt;Patricia Brooks, Jonathan Brooks, ''Laid to Rest in California: A Guide to the Cemeteries and Grave SItes of the Rich and Famous'' (2006), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George McGovern]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt; ''[[60 Minutes]]'' correspondents [[Ed Bradley]] and [[Charlie Rose]]; actors [[Jack Nicholson]], [[John Cusack]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Sean Penn]], and [[Josh Hartnett]]; musicians [[Lyle Lovett]], [[John Oates]] and [[David Amram]], and artist and long-time friend [[Ralph Steadman]].

==Legacy==
===Writing style===
{{Main article|Gonzo journalism}}
Thompson is often credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style are considered to be a major part of the [[New Journalism]] literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the [[first person narrative|first person]], while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color &quot;the story&quot; he was trying to follow. His writing aimed to be humorous, colorful and bizarre, and he often exaggerated events to be more entertaining. The term Gonzo has since been applied in kind to numerous other forms of highly subjective artistic expression.

Despite his having personally described his work as &quot;Gonzo&quot;, it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in ''[[Playboy]]'' addressed the issue himself, saying &quot;Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter.&quot; [[Tom Wolfe]] would later describe Thompson's style as &quot;...&amp;nbsp;part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfetom&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=As Gonzo in Life as in His Work|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222142331/http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325 |archivedate=February 22, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, &quot;While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a [[fly in the ointment]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780345396358.html |title=Better Than Sex by Hunter S.

The majority of Thompson's most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine. Along with [[Joe Eszterhas]] and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from [[Howlin' Wolf]] to [[Lou Reed]]. Armed with early [[fax]] machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.

Robert Love, Thompson's editor of 23 years at ''Rolling Stone'', wrote that &quot;the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred, and we didn't always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous. But if there were living, identifiable humans in a scene, we took certain steps&amp;nbsp;... Hunter was a close friend of many prominent Democrats, veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered, so when in doubt, we'd call the press secretary. 'People will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or Washington,' he once said, and he was right.&quot;

Discerning the line between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work presented a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work &quot;one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world&quot;, and &quot;for the first-timer&amp;nbsp;... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. You knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and [[caliber]], and there was no faking it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;love-cjr&quot;&gt;Love, Robert. (May–June 2005) {{cite web |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/132678871.html |title=''A Technical Guide For Editing Gonzo''|date=May–June 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410013416/http://cjr.org/issues/2005/3/hst.asp |archivedate=April 10, 2007 |work=Columbia Journalism Review.|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persona===
{{Main article|Raoul Duke}}
Thompson often used a blend of fiction and fact when portraying himself in his writing as well, sometimes using the name [[Raoul Duke]] as an [[author surrogate]] whom he generally described as a callous, erratic, self-destructive journalist who constantly drank alcohol and took hallucinogenic drugs. Fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor.

In the late sixties, Thompson acquired his famous [[Honorary degree|title of]] &quot;Doctor&quot; from the [[Universal Life Church]]. He later preferred to be called Dr. Thompson, and his &quot;alter-ego&quot; [[Raoul Duke]] called himself a &quot;doctor of journalism&quot;. Thompson was as fond of personae as W.C. Fields: besides &quot;Raoul Duke&quot;, Thompson also toyed with the idea of taking the names &quot;Jefferson Rank&quot;, &quot;Gene Skinner&quot;, and &quot;Sebastian Owl&quot; for various purposes literary and non-literary, naming his &quot;compound&quot; in Woody Creek, Colorado, &quot;Owl Farm&quot; after the last of these.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

A number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cohen, Rich|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/books/review/17COHENRE.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=|title=''Gonzo Nights''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunter S.

I'm leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped.

Thompson's writing style and eccentric persona gave him a [[cult following]] in both literary and drug circles, and his cult status expanded into broader areas after being portrayed three times in major motion pictures. Hence, both his writing style and persona have been widely imitated, and his likeness has even become a popular costume choice for [[Halloween]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;hs=293&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=hunter%20s%20thompson%20halloween&amp;spell=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wi |title=Hunter S.

===Political beliefs===
Thompson was a [[firearm]]s and [[Explosive material|explosives]] enthusiast (in his writing and in life) and owned a vast collection of [[handgun]]s, [[rifle]]s, [[shotgun]]s, and various [[automatic firearm|automatic]] and [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] weapons, along with numerous forms of [[Lachrymatory agent|gaseous crowd control]] and many homemade devices. He was a proponent of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to bear arms]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|privacy rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glassie |first=John |title=Hunter S.

Part of his work with The Fourth Amendment Foundation centered around support of Lisl Auman, a [[Colorado]] woman who was sentenced for [[Life imprisonment|life]] in 1997 under [[felony murder rule|felony murder]] charges for the death of police officer Bruce VanderJagt, despite contradictory statements and dubious evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMaken|first=Ryan|title=Hunter S. Thompson's Last Stand|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/mcmaken/mcmaken134.html|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson organized rallies, provided legal support, and co-wrote an article in the June 2004 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' outlining the case. The [[Colorado Supreme Court]] eventually overturned Auman's sentence in March 2005, shortly after Thompson's death, and Auman is now free. Auman's supporters claim Thompson's support and publicity resulted in the successful appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley |first=Matt |title=Lisl Released from Tooley Hall |url=http://www.lisl.com/caseupdate.htm |website=lisl.com |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 14, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506163933/http://www.lisl.com/caseupdate.htm |archivedate=May 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson was also an ardent supporter of [[Drug liberalization|drug legalization]] and became known for his detailed accounts of his own [[Recreational drug use|drug use]]. He was an early supporter of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] and served on the group's advisory board for over 30 years, until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspen Legal Seminar|url=http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=6823|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told an interviewer in 1997 that drugs should be legalized &quot;[a]cross the board. It might be a little rough on some people for a while, but I think it's the only way to deal with drugs. Look at [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]: all it did was make a lot of criminals rich.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fargone&quot;/&gt;

In a 1965 letter to his friend Paul Semonin, Thompson explained an affection for the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], &quot;I have in recent months come to have a certain feeling for [[Joe Hill]] and the Wobbly crowd who, if nothing else, had the right idea. But not the right mechanics. I believe the IWW was probably the last human concept in American politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter S. Thompson ''The Proud Highway: 1955–67, Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman'', p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter to Semonin, Thompson wrote that he agreed with [[Karl Marx]], and compared him to [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter S. Thompson ''The Proud Highway'', p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]], Thompson confided that he was &quot;coming to view the [[free enterprise]] system as the single greatest evil in the history of human savagery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter S. Thompson ''The Proud Highway'', p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''[[Breakfast with Hunter]]'', Hunter S. Thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different [[Che Guevara]] T-shirts. Additionally, actor and friend [[Benicio del Toro]] has stated that Thompson kept a &quot;big&quot; [[Guerrillero Heroico|picture of Che]] in his kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article5324264.ece Hunter S.

Thompson, ''The Great Shark Hunt'', (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;44–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], Thompson voiced skepticism regarding the [[9/11 Commission Report|official story on who was responsible for the attacks]]. He speculated to several interviewers that it may have been [[False flag|conducted by]] [[9/11 conspiracy theories|the U.S. Government or with the government's assistance]], though readily admitting he had no way to prove his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bulger|first=Adam|title=The Hunter S.

In 2004, Thompson wrote: &quot;[[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] was a professional politician, and I despised everything he stood for—but if he were running for president this year against the evil [[George W.

==Works==
{{Main article|Hunter S. Thompson bibliography}}

===Books===
Thompson wrote a number of books, publishing from 1966 to the end of his life. His best-known works include ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', and ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]''.

===Articles===
As a journalist over the course of decades, Thompson published numerous articles in various [[Periodical literature|periodicals]]. He wrote for many publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[The San Juan Star]]'', and ''[[Playboy]]''. He was also guest editor for a single edition of ''The Aspen Daily News''. A collection of 100 of his columns from ''The San Francisco Examiner'' was published in 1988 as ''[[Generation of Swine|Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s]]''. A collection of his articles for ''Rolling Stone'' was released in 2011 as ''[[Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone|Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The book was edited by the magazine's co-founder and publisher, Jann S. Wenner, who also provided an introduction to the collection.

===Letters===
Thompson wrote many letters, which were his primary means of personal communication. He made [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] of all his letters, usually typed, a habit begun in his teenage years.

''The Fear and Loathing Letters'' is a three-volume collection of selections from Thompson's correspondence, edited by the historian [[Douglas Brinkley]]. The first volume, ''The Proud Highway'' was published in 1997, and contains letters from 1955 to 1967. ''[[Fear and Loathing in America]]'' was published in 2000 and contains letters dating from 1968 to 1976. A third volume, titled ''The Mutineer: Rants, Ravings, and Missives from the Mountaintop 1977–2005'' was edited by Douglas Brinkley and published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2005. As of August 2016, it has yet to be sold to the public. It contains a special introduction by Johnny Depp.

===Illustrations===
Accompanying the eccentric and colorful writing of Hunter Thompson, illustrations by British artist [[Ralph Steadman]] offer visual representations of the Gonzo style. Steadman and Thompson developed a close friendship, and often traveled together. Though his illustrations occur in most of Thompson's books, they are conspicuously featured in full page color in Thompson's ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', set in Hawaii.

===Photography===
Thompson was an avid amateur photographer throughout his life and his photos have been exhibited since his death at art galleries in the United States and United Kingdom. In late 2006, AMMO Books published a limited-edition 224-page collection of Thompson photos called ''[[Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson|Gonzo]]'', with an introduction by Johnny Depp. Thompson's snapshots were a combination of the subjects he was covering, stylized self-portraits, and artistic [[still life]] photos. The ''[[London Observer]]'' called the photos &quot;astonishingly good&quot; and noted that &quot;Thompson's pictures remind us, brilliantly in every sense, of very real people, real colours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=Hunter gets captured by the frame|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/04/photography.features|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feature films===
The film ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' (1980) depicts heavily fictionalized attempts by Thompson to cover the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 U.S. presidential election]]. It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson and [[Peter Boyle]] as Thompson's attorney [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], referred to in the movie as Carl Lazlo, Esq.

[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|The 1998 film adaptation]] of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' was directed by [[Monty Python]] veteran [[Terry Gilliam]], and starred Johnny Depp (who moved into Thompson's basement to &quot;study&quot; Thompson's persona before assuming his role in the film) as [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]]. The film has achieved something of a [[cult film|cult following]].

[[The Rum Diary (film)|The film adaptation]] of Thompson's novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was released in October 2011, also starring Johnny Depp as the main character, Paul Kemp. The novel's premise was inspired by Thompson's own experiences in Puerto Rico. The film was written and directed by [[Bruce Robinson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rumdiaryimdb&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The Rum Diary (2011) – IMDb| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376136/| accessdate = December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a press junket for ''The Rum Diary'' shortly before the film's release, Depp said that he would like to adapt ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', &quot;[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]&quot;, and ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' for the big screen: &quot;I'd just keep playing Hunter. There's a great comfort in it for me, because I get a great visit with my old friend who I miss dearly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mryan |url=http://www.movieline.com/2011/10/johnny-depp-bruce-robinson-and-co-exalt-hunter-s-thompson-while-talking-the-rum-diary.php |title=Johnny Depp, Bruce Robinson, and Co.

===Documentaries===
''[[Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood|Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision]]'' (1978) is an extended television profile by the [[BBC]]. It can be found on disc 2 of [[The Criterion Collection]] edition of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.

The [[Mitchell brothers]], owners of the O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, made a documentary about Thompson in 1988 called ''Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die''.

[[Wayne Ewing]] created three documentaries about Thompson. The film ''[[Breakfast with Hunter]]'' (2003) was directed and edited by Ewing. It documents Thompson's work on the movie ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', his arrest for [[drunk driving]], and his subsequent fight with the court system. ''When I Die'' (2005) is a video chronicle of making Thompson's final farewell wishes a reality, and documents the send-off itself. ''Free Lisl: Fear and Loathing in Denver'' (2006) chronicles Thompson's efforts in helping to free Lisl Auman, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the shooting of a police officer, a crime she didn't commit. All three films are only available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunterthompsonfilms.com/ |title=Hunter Thompson Films |publisher=Hunter Thompson Films |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manifestation.tv/ |title=Manifestation.tv |publisher=Manifestation.tv |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2004) Thompson gives director Adamm Liley insight into the nature of the American Dream over drinks at the Woody Creek Tavern.

''[[Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride: Hunter S. Thompson on Film]]'' (2006) was directed by [[Tom Thurman]], written by Tom Marksbury, and produced by the [[Starz Entertainment Group]]. The original documentary features interviews with Thompson's inner circle of family and friends, but the thrust of the film focuses on the manner in which his life often overlapped with numerous Hollywood celebrities who became his close friends, such as Johnny Depp, [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Sean Penn]], [[John Cusack]], Thompson's wife Anita, son Juan, former Senators [[George McGovern]] and [[Gary Hart]], writers [[Tom Wolfe]] and [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]], actors [[Gary Busey]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and the illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]] among others.

''Blasted!!! The Gonzo Patriots of Hunter S. Thompson'' (2006), produced, directed, photographed and edited by Blue Kraning, is a documentary about the scores of fans who volunteered their privately owned artillery to fire the ashes of the late author, Hunter S. Thompson. ''Blasted!!!'' premiered at the 2006 Starz Denver International Film Festival, part of a tribute series to Hunter S. Thompson held at the Denver Press Club.

In 2008, [[Academy Award]]-winning documentarian [[Alex Gibney]] (''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'', ''[[Taxi to the Dark Side]]'') wrote and directed a documentary on Thompson, titled ''[[Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The film premiered on January 20, 2008, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Gibney uses intimate, never-before-seen home videos, interviews with friends, enemies and lovers, and clips from films adapted from Thompson's material to document his turbulent life.

===Theater===
Lou Stein's adaptation of &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; was performed at the Battersea theatre. Stein persuades London's 'Time Out' Magazine to put Thompson up for a fortnight, in exchange for him writing a cover story to publicize the play. Thompson doesn't write the story, but does rampage around London on Time Out's expense account. The play was revived for the Vault Fringe Festival in 2014.

''GONZO: A Brutal Chrysalis'' is a one-man show about Thompson written by Paul Addis, who also played the author. Set in the writing den of Thompson's Woody Creek home, the show portrays his life between 1968 and 1971. James Cartee began playing the role soon after Addis's arrest in 2009, and again after Addis's death in 2012.

===Accolades and tributes===
*Author [[Tom Wolfe]] has called Thompson the greatest American comic writer of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfetom&quot;/&gt;
*Asked in an interview with Jody Denberg on KGSR Studio, in 2000, whether he would ever consider writing a book &quot;like [his] buddy Hunter S.

Thompson is the finest writer of our generation; he didn't just toss off a book the other day...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jseKHl8lOa8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thompson appeared on the cover of the 1,000th issue of ''Rolling Stone'', May 18 – June 1, 2006, as a devil playing the guitar next to the two &quot;L&quot;'s in the word &quot;Rolling&quot;.

*The Thompson-inspired character [[Uncle Duke]] appears on a recurring basis in ''[[Doonesbury]]'', the daily newspaper comic strip by [[Garry Trudeau]]. When the character was first introduced, Thompson protested, quoted in an interview as saying that he would set Trudeau on fire if the two ever met,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7005168/ |date=May 19, 2005 |title=Hunter S.

Between March 7, 2005 (roughly two weeks after Thompson's suicide) and March 12, 2005, ''Doonesbury'' ran a tribute to Hunter, with Uncle Duke lamenting the death of the man he called his &quot;inspiration&quot;. The first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar to that of [[Ralph Steadman]], and later strips featured various [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequiturs]] (with Duke variously transforming into a monster, melting, shrinking to the size of an empty drinking glass, or people around him turning into animals) which seemed to mirror some of the effects of hallucinogenic drugs described in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.
*General Hunter Gathers in the [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' is a tribute to Thompson and derives his physical appearance from him.

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. &quot;Historicism.&quot; ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term &quot;historicism&quot; (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: &quot;[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history...&quot;; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: &quot;Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are &quot;inexorable laws of historical destiny&quot;, which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term &quot;[[New Historicism]]&quot;, which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

==Variants==

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the &quot;spirit&quot; (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence &quot;through the activity of finite agents.&quot; Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this &quot;Hegelian&quot; philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan &quot;[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]&quot;.  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], &quot;Philosophy is the history of philosophy,&quot; describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the &quot;Spirit of the Age,&quot; is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of &quot;historical inevitabilities&quot; and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the &quot;modern&quot; need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3&quot;], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few &quot;cradles of civilization&quot; which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named &quot;historicism.&quot;

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. &quot;They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as &quot;vulgar&quot; Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | work = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: &quot;an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Poverty 3&quot;&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of &quot;historicism&quot; is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks &quot;historicism&quot; and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all &quot;enemies of the open society&quot;.  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms &quot;moral historicism&quot;, the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that &quot;history is the world's court of justice&quot;.  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe &quot;that success proves anything or that history is our judge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls &quot;[[Historism]]&quot;, which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the &quot;[[New Historicism]]&quot; is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of &quot;natural right&quot; or &quot;right by nature&quot;).  Strauss argued that historicism &quot;rejects political philosophy&quot; (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that &quot;all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch.&quot; Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or &quot;subjectivize&quot;) all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or &quot;objective&quot; &quot;value.&quot; Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a &quot;radical historicist&quot; who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

==History==

===Founding===

[[File:Normal College of Women 801201.png|thumb|right|287px|New York Normal College seen from Park Avenue (1874); from a photo by [[George G. Rockwood]]]]

Hunter College has its origins in the 19th-century movement for [[normal school]] training which swept across the [[United States]]. Hunter descends from the Female Normal and High School (later renamed the Normal College of the City of New York), established in [[New York City]] in 1870. Founded by Irish immigrant [[Thomas Hunter (school founder)|Thomas Hunter]], who was president of the school during the first 37 years, it was originally a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] for training teachers. The school, which was housed in an armory and saddle store at Broadway and East Fourth Street in Manhattan, was open to all qualified women, irrespective of race, religion or ethnic background.  At the time most women's colleges had racial or ethno-religious admissions criteria.

Created by the New York State Legislature, Hunter was deemed the only approved institution for those seeking to teach in New York City. The school incorporated an elementary and high school for [[gifted children]], where students practiced teaching. In 1887, a [[kindergarten]] was established as well. (Today, the [[Hunter College Elementary School|elementary school]] and the [[Hunter College High School|high school]] still exist at a different location, and are now called the Hunter College Campus Schools.)

During Thomas Hunter's tenure as president of the school, Hunter became known for its impartiality regarding race, religion, ethnicity, financial or political favoritism; its pursuit of higher education for women; its high entry requirements; and its rigorous academics. The first female professor at the school, [[Helen Gray Cone]], was elected to the position in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Young Women Graduated|date=June 23, 1899|work=New York Times|publisher=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The college's student population quickly expanded, and the college subsequently moved uptown, in 1873, into a new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structure, now known as Thomas Hunter Hall, on Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets. The hall was probably designed by the architect Snyder.

In 1888 the school was incorporated as a college under the statutes of New York State, with the power to confer the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] This led to the separation of the school into two &quot;camps&quot;: the &quot;Normals&quot;, who pursued a four-year course of study to become licensed teachers, and the &quot;Academics&quot;, who sought non-teaching professions and the Bachelor of Arts degree. After 1902 when the &quot;Normal&quot; course of study was abolished, the &quot;Academic&quot; course became standard across the student body.

===Expansion===
[[File:Hunter College NY WAVES camp opening 1943.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Opening of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] recruit camp for [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service|WAVES]] at Bronx Campus, February 8, 1943]]

In 1914 the Normal College became Hunter College in honor of its first president. At the same time, the college was experiencing a period of great expansion as increasing student enrollments necessitated more space. The college reacted by establishing branches in the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]. By 1920, Hunter College had the largest enrollment of women of any municipally financed college in the United States. In 1930, Hunter's Brooklyn campus merged with [[City College of New York|City College]]'s Brooklyn campus, and the two were spun off to form [[Brooklyn College]].

Between 1938 and 1939 the garden at Park Avenue was given up for the construction of the north building. The expansion also destroyed a large part of the neo-gothic original structure, fusing them together. Only the back part facing Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th street remain from the original building.

The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus). During the [[Second World War]], Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the [[United States Navy]] who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as [[WAVES]] and [[SPARS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003129-00/sec4.htm |title=Free A Marine to Fight: Women Marines in World War II (Early Training: Holyoke and Hunter) |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent [[United Nations]], which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/programs/grad/187.htm History of Lehman College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830080929/http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/programs/grad/187.htm |date=August 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] dedicated a town house at 47–49 East 65th Street in Manhattan to the college. The house had been a home for the future [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President]] and First Lady. Today it is known as The Roosevelt House of Public Policy and opened in fall 2010 as an academic center hosting prominent speakers.

===CUNY era===

[[File:West Building Hunter College CUNY.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The West (seen here in the background) and East Buildings were constructed in 1981-86 &amp;ndash; held up by the city's fiscal crisis &amp;ndash; and were designed in the [[Modernist architecture|Modernist style]] by [[Ulrich Franzen]] &amp; Associates; skyways connect all the buildings]]

Hunter became the [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] of the municipal system, and in the 1950s, when [[City College of New York|City College]] became [[coeducational]], Hunter started admitting men to its [[Bronx]] campus. In 1964, the [[Manhattan]] campus began admitting men also. The Bronx campus subsequently became [[Lehman College]] in 1968.

In 1968–1969, Black and Puerto Rican students struggled to get a department that would teach about their history and experience. These and supportive students and faculty expressed this demand through building take-overs, rallies, etc. In Spring 1969, Hunter College established Black and Puerto Rican Studies (now called Africana/Puerto Rican and Latino Studies). An &quot;[[open admissions]]&quot; policy initiated in 1970 by the City University of New York opened the school's doors to historically underrepresented groups by guaranteeing a college education to any and all who graduated from NYC high schools. Many African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and students from the developing world made their presence felt at Hunter, and even after the end of &quot;open admissions&quot; still comprise a large part of the school's student body. As a result of this increase in enrollment, Hunter opened new buildings on Lexington Avenue during the early 1980s. In further advancing Puerto Rican studies, Hunter became home to the [[Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños]] (&quot;Center for Puerto Rican Studies&quot; or simply &quot;Centro&quot;) in 1982.

Today, Hunter College is a comprehensive teaching and research institution. Of the more than 20,000 students enrolled at Hunter, nearly 5,000 are enrolled in a graduate program, the most popular of which are education and [[social work]]. Although less than 28% of students are the first in their families to attend college, the college maintains its tradition of concern for women's education, with nearly three out of four students being female. In 2006, Hunter became home to the [[Bella Abzug]] Leadership Institute, which will run training programs for young women to build their leadership, public speaking, business and advocacy skills. [[Princeton Review]] named the college as [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/news/#bestvalue one of America's &quot;Best Value&quot; Colleges] in its 2007 guide.

In recent years, the college has integrated its undergraduate and graduate programs to successfully make advanced programs in fields such as ([[Psychology]] and [[Biology]]) – &quot;Ph.D Program&quot;, ([[Education]]) – &quot;Master's Program&quot;, ([[Mathematics]]) – &quot;Master's Program&quot;, -&quot;Ph.D Program&quot; ([[Biology]] &amp; [[Chemistry]]) – &quot;[[Biochemistry]]&quot;, ([[Accounting]]) – &quot;Master's Program&quot; along with the highly competitive ([[Economics]]) – &quot;Master's Program&quot; to which only a select few students may enter based on excellent scholarship and performance, and less than half will earn a master's degree by maintaining a nearly perfect academic record and performing thesis research.

Although far from the polar regions, Hunter is a member institution of the [[University of the Arctic]], a network of schools providing education accessible to northern students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uarctic.org/orgs2full.aspx?group=GOvCouncil&amp;title=Council&amp;m=79|title=University of the Arctic – MEMBERS – LIST OF MEMBERS|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707084534/http://www.uarctic.org/orgs2full.aspx?group=GOvCouncil&amp;title=Council&amp;m=79|archivedate=July 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter College is anchored by its main campus at East 68th Street and Lexington Avenue, a modern complex of three towers — the East, West, and North Buildings — and Thomas Hunter Hall, all of which are interconnected by skywalks. The college's official street address is 695 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]], New York, NY 10065. (Formerly bearing the [[ZIP code]] of 10021, the code changed on July 1, 2007 in accordance with the [[United States Postal Service]]'s plan to split the 10021 ZIP code.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/nyregion/21zip.html An Elite ZIP Code Becomes Harder to Crack], [[New York Times]], March 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It claims a Park Avenue address by virtue of the North Building, which stretches from 68th to 69th Streets along Park Avenue.

The main campus is situated within walking distance of [[Central Park]], as well as many of New York's most prestigious cultural institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Asia Society]] Museum, and the [[Frick Collection]].

Adjacent to the staircase to the station, in front of the West Building, sits an iconic Hunter sculpture, &quot;Tau&quot;, created by late Hunter professor and respected artist [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]].

The main campus is home to the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education. It features numerous facilities that serve not only Hunter, but the surrounding community, and is particularly well known as a center for the arts. The Assembly Hall, which seats more than 2,000, is a major performance site; the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse, a 675-seat [[proscenium theatre]], has over 100,000 visitors annually and hosts over 200 performances each season; the Ida K.

===Satellite campuses===
Hunter has two satellite campuses: The Silberman School of Social Work Building, located on 3rd Avenue between East 118th and East 119th Streets, which houses the School of Social Work, the School of Urban Public Health, and the Brookdale Center on Aging; and the Brookdale Campus, located at East 25th Street and 1st Avenue, which houses the [[Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing]], the Schools of the Health Professions, the Health Professions Library and several research centers and computer labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentservices.hunter.cuny.edu/reslife/reslife_brookdale.htm |title=&quot;Brookdale Campus&quot;, December 2, 2007 |publisher=Studentservices.hunter.cuny.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brookdale Campus is the site of the Hunter dormitory, which is home to over 600 undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a limited number of nurses employed at Bellevue Hospital. Prior to the opening of City College's new &quot;Towers,&quot; the Brookdale complex was the City University's only dormitory facility.

===Other facilities===
[[File:Thomas Hunter Hall Hunter College CUNY from north.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thomas Hunter Hall was originally built in 1912–14 as a high school connected to Normal College (later [[Hunter College High School]]), and was designed by [[C.

Out of 442 nationally ranked colleges and universities, Hunter is No. 2 in the number of women graduates who pursue PhDs and No. 9 in the number of minority graduates who pursue PhDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/sciencebuilding/FAQ.html The Challenge Facing Hunter's Science and Health Professions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405140847/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/sciencebuilding/FAQ.html |date=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate study conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] for the period 1999–2003, out of 604 institutions of higher education evaluated, Hunter was No. 6 in the total number of doctorate recipients earned by undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.org/nr/rdonlyres/ada68082-6fd6-4a18-8043-cd885e390298/0/sed2003.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727130600/http://www.norc.org/nr/rdonlyres/ada68082-6fd6-4a18-8043-cd885e390298/0/sed2003.pdf |date=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hunter—along with the U.S. Military academy—was among only seven universities nationwide to receive the highest ranking out of 130 colleges and universities evaluated by the [[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]] (ACTA). The ACTA report, &quot;What Will They Learn? A Report on General Education Requirements at 100 of the Nation's Leading Colleges and Universities,&quot; ranks colleges in the first category (or a letter grade of A) if the college requires all students to take courses in six of seven academic areas: composition, literature, foreign languages, U.S. government or history, economics, mathematics and natural or physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatwilltheylearn.com/a-list |title=&quot;A&quot; List – What Will They Learn? |publisher=Whatwilltheylearn.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2009/08/19/2009-08-19_2_big_apple_colleges_tops_at_their_core.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Big Apple schools Hunter and Brooklyn colleges shine at their core | first1=Denise | last1=Romano | first2=Oren | last2=Yaniv | first3=Elizabeth | last3=Lazarowitz | date=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors programs===
Hunter offers several honors programs, including the Macaulay Honors College and the Thomas Hunter Honors Program. The Honors College, a CUNY-wide honors program, supports the undergraduate education of academically gifted students. University Scholars benefit from a full tuition scholarship (for NYS students only as of Fall 2013), personalized advising, early registration, access to internships, and study abroad opportunities. All scholars at Hunter are given the choice of either a free dormitory room at the Brookdale Campus for two years or a yearly stipend.&lt;ref&gt;http://macaulay.cuny.edu, &quot;Macaulay Honors College at CUNY-Hunter College&quot;, December 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thomas Hunter Honors Program offers topical interdisciplinary seminars and academic concentrations designed to meet students’ individual interests. The program is open to outstanding students pursuing a BA and is orchestrated under the supervision of an Honors Council. It can be combined with, or replace, a formal departmental major/minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/honors/ |title=&quot;Thomas Hunter Honors Program&quot;, December 1, 2007 |publisher=Hunter.cuny.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter offers other honors programs, including: Honors Research Training Programs and Departmental Honors opportunities, The Muse Scholar program, the Jenny Hunter program, the Athena program, and the Yallow program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/honorsprograms/dept.shtml |title=Honors Programs At Hunter College |publisher=Hunter.cuny.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these honors programs, several honors societies are based at Hunter, including [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (PBK). A small percentage of Hunter students are invited to join Hunter's Nu chapter of PBK, which has existed at the college since 1920. Less than 10% of the nation's liberal arts colleges qualify academically for a PBK chapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Hunter: In Brief, 12/1/07&quot;/&gt;

'''Harry Julius Shearer''' (born December 23, 1943) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian, writer, musician, radio host, director and producer. He is known for his long-running roles on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', his work on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the comedy band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] and his radio program ''[[Le Show]]''. Born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Shearer began his career as a child actor. From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group. Following the breakup of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'' with [[Albert Brooks]] and started writing for [[Martin Mull]]'s television series ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]''.

He was a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on two occasions, between 1979–80, and 1984–85. Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', a [[satire|satirical]] [[rockumentary]], which became a cult hit. In 1989, Shearer joined the cast of ''[[The Simpsons]]''; he provides voices for numerous characters, including [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Principal Skinner]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]] and more. Shearer has appeared in several films, including ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' and ''[[The Truman Show]]'', has directed two, ''[[Teddy Bears' Picnic (film)|Teddy Bears' Picnic]]'' and ''The Big Uneasy'', and has written three books. Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program ''[[Le Show]]'', a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and [[sketch comedy]].

Shearer has won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in the radio category, and has received several other Emmy and [[Grammy Award]] nominations. He has been married to singer-songwriter [[Judith Owen]] since 1993. He is currently &quot;artist in residence&quot; at [[Loyola University, New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/news/story/2013/6/10/3207 |title='The Simpsons' voice actor Harry Shearer makes a home at Loyola - Loyola University New Orleans |publisher=Loyno.edu |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shearer was born December 23, 1943 in [[Los Angeles]], the son of Dora Warren (née Kohn) (d. 2008), a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer.&lt;ref name=&quot;thejc&quot;/&gt; His parents were [[Jew]]ish immigrants from Austria and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8329 |title=Shearer Enjoyment |work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |accessdate=2009-04-30 |date=March 28, 2002 |author=Pfefferman, Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/31034/edition_id/581/format/html/displaystory.html |title=j. – 'Hi-diddly-ho, Marin!' Man of many voices Harry Shearer comes to JCC |work=Jewish Weekly |accessdate=2009-04-30 |date=December 1, 2006 |author=Eskenazi, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a children's agent, as she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 1 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035860p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described [[Jack Benny]] as &quot;very warm and approachable [...] He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; Shearer said in an interview that one person who &quot;took him under his wing&quot; and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor [[Mel Blanc]], who voiced many animated characters, including [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Barney Rubble]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=5&amp;entry_id=11888 |title=Chronicle Podcasts : New Orleans economy stillborn, says Harry Shearer |date=August 25, 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film ''[[Abbott and Costello Go to Mars]]'', in which he only had a small part. Later that year, he made his first big film performance in ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; Throughout his childhood and teenage years he worked in television, film, and radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/harry-shearer,13807/ |title=Harry Shearer |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |date=April 23, 2003 |work=The A.V. Club |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the [[Eddie Haskell]] character in the pilot episode of the television series ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''. After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt;

Shearer attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] as a political science major in the early 1960s and decided to quit show business to become a &quot;serious person&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt; However, he says this lasted approximately a month, and he joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', UCLA's school newspaper, during his first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt; and as editor of the college humor magazine (Satyr) including the June 1964 parody, Preyboy &lt;ref&gt;Preyboy&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a newscaster at KRLA, a top 40 radio station in Pasadena, during this period.  According to Shearer, after graduating, he had &quot;a very serious agenda going on, and it was 'Stay Out of the Draft'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt; He attended [[graduate school]] at [[Harvard University]] for one year and worked at the state legislature in [[Sacramento]]. In 1967 and 1968, he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following &quot;disagreements with the administration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt;

From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group that included [[David Lander]], [[Richard Beebe]] and [[Michael McKean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p149 |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Credibility Gap |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=Deming, Mark |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group consisted of &quot;a bunch of newsmen&quot; at [[KRLA 1110]], &quot;the number two station&quot; in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. By the time he got home, there was a message on his answering machine asking, &quot;Can you come to work tomorrow?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by [[KPPC-FM]], so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt; While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] for the [[Pop Chronicles]] music documentary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliland&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/e-l |title=Index to Interviews |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=2008-01-02 |authorlink=John Gilliland |last=Gilliland |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on ''[[How Time Flys]]'', an album by [[The Firesign Theatre]]'s [[David Ossman]]. The Credibility Gap broke up 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt; Shearer started working with [[Albert Brooks]], producing one of Brooks' albums and co-writing the film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]''. Shearer also started writing for [[Martin Mull]]'s television series ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt; In the mid-1970s, he started working with [[Rob Reiner]] on a pilot for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show, which starred [[Christopher Guest]], [[Tom Leopold]] and McKean, was not picked up.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign1&quot;/&gt;

==Career==

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', one of the first additions to the cast,&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; and an unofficial replacement for [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]], who were both leaving the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 2 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035861p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Franken]] recommended Shearer to ''Saturday Night Live'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer describes his experience on the show as a &quot;living hell&quot; and &quot;not a real pleasant place to work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt; He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for latter episodes of the 1979-80 season) and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels left ''Saturday Night Live'' at the end of the fifth season, taking the entire cast with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer told new executive producer [[Jean Doumanian]] that he was &quot;not a fan of Lorne's&quot; and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box |width=30em |bgcolor=transparent |align=right |halign=left |quote=When I left, Dick [Ebersol] issued a press release, saying &quot;creative differences.&quot; And the first person who called me for a comment on it read me that and I blurted out, &quot;Yeah, I was creative and they were different.&quot; |salign=right |source=—Harry Shearer&lt;ref name=&quot;Shales287&quot;/&gt;}}
In 1984, while promoting the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had a performance on ''Saturday Night Live''. All three members were offered the chance to join to the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt; but later stated that he &quot;didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. [[Dick Ebersol]], who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was &quot;a gifted performer but a pain in the butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good,&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt; partially because he felt he was not being used enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shales287&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Short]] said Shearer &quot;wanted to be creative and Dick [Ebersol] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shales|Miller|2002 |p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinal Tap===
Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest received a deal to write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what they wanted to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt; It was eventually greenlighted by [[Norman Lear]] and [[Jerry Perenchio]] at [[Embassy Pictures]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt; The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, as well as the [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tendencies of [[rockumentary|rockumentaries]] of the time. The three core members of the band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]—[[David St. Hubbins]], [[Derek Smalls]] and [[Nigel Tufnel]]—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt; It was filmed in 25 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign2&quot;/&gt;

Shearer said in an interview that &quot;The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thejc&quot;/&gt; When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, &quot;No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know,&quot; so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a [[cult following]], after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs |date=June 14, 2000 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615021804/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |archivedate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html |title=Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989–2008 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shearer, Guest and McKean have since worked on several projects as their Spinal Tap characters. They released three albums: ''[[This Is Spinal Tap (album)|This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984), ''[[Break Like the Wind]]'' (1992) and ''[[Back from the Dead (Spinal Tap album)|Back From The Dead]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/spinaltap/discography |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2009-05-01 |title=Spinal Tap: Discography |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309202710/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/spinaltap/discography |archivedate=March 9, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Spinal Tap appeared in an episode of ''The Simpsons'' called &quot;[[The Otto Show]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page22.shtml |title=The Otto Show |accessdate=2009-05-01 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has played several concerts, including at [[Live Earth]] in London on July 7, 2007. In anticipation of the show, Rob Reiner directed a short film entitled ''Spinal Tap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/this-is-climate-change/2007/04/26/1177459821738.html |title=Spinal Tap reunite |work=[[The Age]] |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the band released ''Back from the Dead'' to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spinal Tap to return with new album |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/04/spinal-tap-record-new-album |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 4, 2009 |author=Michaels, Sean |accessdate=2009-04-30 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features re-recorded versions of songs featured in ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and its soundtrack, and five new songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Review of ''Back from the Dead'' |url={{Allmusic |class=album |id=r1575008 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandy |last=Kaczmarski |title=''Unwigged and Unplugged: Spinal Tap Unwiped'' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sandy-kaczmarski/unwigged-and-unplugged-sp_b_209526.html |publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]'' |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band performed a one date &quot;world tour&quot; at London's [[Wembley Arena]] on June 30, 2009. [[The Folksmen]], a mock band featured in the film ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' that is also made up of characters played by Shearer, McKean and Guest&amp;nbsp;– was the opening act for the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcworldtour&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7985487.stm |title=Spinal Tap announce 'world tour' |date=April 6, 2009 |publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Simpsons''===
Shearer is also known for his prolific work as a voice actor on ''The Simpsons''. [[Matt Groening]], the creator of the show, was a fan of Shearer's work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 3 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035862p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer was asked if he wanted to be in the series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign3&quot;/&gt; He felt voice acting was &quot;not a lot of fun&quot; because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;/&gt; He was told that the actors would record their lines together&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;/&gt; and after three calls, executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] managed to convince Shearer to join the cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;thejc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/articles/interview-harry-shearer |title=Interview: Harry Shearer |last=Round |first=Simon |date=October 10, 2008 |work=The Jewish Chronicle |accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer's first impression of ''The Simpsons'' was that it was funny. Shearer, who thought it was a &quot;pretty cool&quot; way to work, found it peculiar that the members of the cast were adamant about not being known to the public as the people behind the voices.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Mr Burns.png|thumb|upright|Shearer's character Mr. Burns]]
Shearer provides voices for [[Principal Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]], [[Lenny Leonard]], [[Otto Mann]], [[Rainier Wolfcastle]], [[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show|Scratchy]], [[Kang and Kodos|Kang]], [[Dr. Marvin Monroe]], [[Judge Snyder]] and many others.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}} He has described all of his regular characters' voices as &quot;easy to slip into. [...] I wouldn't do them if they weren't easy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign3&quot;/&gt; Shearer modeled Mr. Burns's voice on the two actors [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite news |title=Real People are Models for 'Simpsons' Voices |publisher=Times-Union |date=April 28, 1994 |author=Marder, Keith |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer says that Burns is the most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cineplex.com/Movies/FamousNews/FamousMagazine/July%202007.aspx?FamousArticles=4395 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026153459/https://www.cineplex.com/Movies/FamousNews/FamousMagazine/July%202007.aspx?FamousArticles=4395 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-26 |title=Burns, Baby, Burns |accessdate=2008-05-05 |date=July 2007 |author=Dittman, Earl |publisher=[[Cineplex Entertainment]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes Burns as his favorite character, saying he &quot;like[s] Mr. Burns because he is pure evil.

In 2004, Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: &quot;I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]] looks very good to me now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;legget&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Leggett |title=Harry Shearer |publisher=UK Teletext |date=August 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearer has also been vocal about &quot;[[The Principal and the Pauper]]&quot; ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997) one of the most controversial episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that [[Principal Seymour Skinner]], a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, &quot;That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters.

{{quote box |width=30em |bgcolor=transparent |align=right |halign=left |quote=&quot;Because I don't do stand-up, radio has always been my equivalent, a place to stay in connection with the public and force myself to write every week and come up with new characters.

Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program ''[[Le Show]]''. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the &quot;mega morons of the mighty media&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Shearer – a radio rebel? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/3763036.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-04-30 |date=November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is carried on many [[National Public Radio]] and other public radio stations throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.harryshearer.com/syndicates.html |title=Le Show Syndicate Stations |publisher=HarryShearer.com |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206232020/http://media.harryshearer.com/syndicates.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the merger of [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio|SIRIUS]] and [[XM Public Radio|XM]] satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either.&lt;ref name=&quot;leShow20090118&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.harryshearer.com/?ProgramID=675 |last=Shearer |first=Harry |title=le Show |publisher=HarryShearer.com |date=January 18, 2009 |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428233508/http://media.harryshearer.com/?ProgramID=675 |archivedate=April 28, 2009 |df= }} (Comment is at 57:06).&lt;/ref&gt; The show has also been made available as a [[podcast]] on [[iTunes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on the news of the day after the manner of [[Mort Sahl]], and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called ''Songs of the Bushmen'', consisting of his satirical numbers about former President [[George W.

'''High fantasy''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[fantasy]],&lt;ref name=High_fantasy_is_a_fantasy_genre&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fandomania.com/defining-the-genre-high-fantasy/ |title=''Defining the Genre: High Fantasy'' |work=fandomania |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2016 |quote=&quot;High Fantasy is probably one of the most recognizable subgenres of Fantasy.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined either by its [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] or by the epic stature of its [[Character (arts)|characters]], [[Theme (narrative)|themes]], and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stableford&quot;&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'', (p. 198), Scarecrow Press, Plymouth. 2005. {{ISBN|0-8108-6829-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;high fantasy&quot; was coined by [[Lloyd Alexander]] in a 1971 essay, &quot;High Fantasy and Heroic Romance&quot; (originally given at the New England Round Table of Children's Librarians in October 1969).&lt;ref name=&quot;stableford&quot; /&gt;

==Genre overview==

High fantasy is defined as fantasy set in an alternative, fictional (&quot;secondary&quot;) world, rather than &quot;the real&quot;, or &quot;primary&quot; world.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The secondary world is usually internally consistent, but its rules differ from those of the primary world. By contrast, [[low fantasy]] is characterized by being set in the primary, or &quot;real&quot; world, or a rational and familiar fictional world, with the inclusion of magical elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading and Writing Literary Genres |last1=Buss |first1=Kathleen |authorlink= |last2=Karnowski |first2=Lee |year=2000 |publisher=International Reading Assoc. |location= |isbn=978-0-87207-257-2 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Fantasy Novels |last=Perry |first=Phyllis Jean |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location= |isbn=978-1-56308-987-9 |page=vi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamble&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Children's Literature |last1=Gamble |first1=Nikki |authorlink= |last2=Yates |first2=Sally |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd |location= |isbn=978-1-4129-3013-0 |pages= 102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Sullivan has a slightly more complex definition in &quot;High Fantasy&quot;, chapter 24 of the ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' by Peter Hunt and Sheila G. Bannister Ray (Routledge, 1996 and 2004), chapter 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The romances of [[William Morris]], such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]'', set in an imaginary medieval world, are sometimes regarded as the first examples of high fantasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;dg&quot;&gt;[[Gardner Dozois]], &quot;Introduction&quot; to ''Modern Classics of Fantasy''.  New York : St. Martin's Press, 1997. (xvi-xvii) {{ISBN|031215173X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]—especially ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''—are regarded as archetypal works of high fantasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;dg&quot; /&gt; [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]]'' is another example of a high fantasy series.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stephen R. Donaldson's ''[[Lord Foul's Bane]]'' is a High Fantasy that is often compared with Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' ... but Donaldson's approach to his Secondary World, the Land, differs in remarkable ways&quot;. (p. 123) [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James E. Gunn]], ''Paratexts: Introductions to science fiction and fantasy'' Lanham : The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2013. {{ISBN|9780810891227}} (p. 123)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many high fantasy stories are told from the viewpoint of one main [[hero]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Often, much of the plot revolves around his or her heritage or mysterious nature. In many novels the hero is an [[orphan]] or unusual sibling, often with an extraordinary talent for magic or combat. He or she begins the story young, if not as an actual child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Moorcock|title=Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy|page= 84 |isbn= 1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other works the hero is a completely developed individual with a unique character and spirit.

The hero often begins as a childlike figure, but matures rapidly, experiencing a huge gain in fighting/problem-solving abilities along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Casey Lieb, &quot;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/gm/lieb14.html Unlikely Heroes and their role in Fantasy Literature]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the story often depicts the hero's fight against the evil forces as a [[Bildungsroman]].

In many books there is a knowing, mystical [[mentor]]/[[teacher]]. This character is often a formidable wizard or warrior, who provides the main character with advice and help.

In some books, there is also a mysterious [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]], often obsessed with taking over the world and killing the main hero. This character is an evil wizard or sorcerer, or sometimes a kind of god or demon. This character commands a huge army and a group of highly feared servants. In some works the villain may have had a predecessor/s who might have been superior or inferior to them.

The progress of the story leads to the character learning the nature of the unknown forces against him, that they constitute a force with great power and malevolence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia A. McKillip]], &quot;Writing High Fantasy&quot;, p 53, Philip Martin, ed., ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The good versus evil fighting against each other is a common theme in high fantasy, and the character of evil is often an important theme in a work of high fantasy,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'', p 120, {{ISBN|0-618-25759-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Indeed, the importance of the concepts of good and evil can be regarded as the distinguishing mark between high fantasy and [[sword and sorcery]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A.

'''Human sexual activity''', '''human sexual practice''' or '''human sexual behaviour''' is the manner in which humans experience and express their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.

Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.

In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most&lt;!--virtually all?--&gt; [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].

==Types==

Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.

Sexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;channel1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again – Sexual Fitness – physiology &amp;#124; Men's Fitness &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, armpits or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==
[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]
The [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schacter&quot;&gt;{{cite book | authors=Daniel L.

* During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a &quot;[[sex flush]]&quot; on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schacter&quot;/&gt; A male's penis will become erect.
* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [[semen]]. A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schacter&quot;/&gt;
* During the [[orgasm]] phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having [[Fake orgasm|faked it]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schacter&quot;/&gt; A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schacter&quot;/&gt;
* During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O &amp; Mannila, E (2009).

==Psychological aspects==
Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It releases tension, elevates mood, and may create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.

===Motivations===
{{anchor|Reasons_for_sexual_activity}}
{{Redirect|Pity sex|the American rock band|Pity Sex}}
People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: ''physical attraction'', as a ''means to an end'', to increase ''emotional connection'', and to ''alleviate insecurity''.&lt;ref&gt;Meston &amp; Buss, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the [[sexual arousal|arousal of their sexuality]], especially if they can achieve [[orgasm]]. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from [[foreplay]] and flirting, and from [[Fetishism|fetish]] or BDSM activities,&lt;ref name=&quot;channel1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-05-26 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again&amp;nbsp;— Sexual Fitness&amp;nbsp;— physiology | year=2002 | work=Men's Fitness}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Eroticism|erotic activities]]. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the [[sexual desire]] generated by a person to whom they feel [[sexual attraction]]; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of [[Casual sex|casual or social sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual%20sex|title=Casual sex - Define Casual sex at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.

A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of [[Fertilisation|conception]]. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten [[sexual tension]], attraction and interest.&lt;ref name=Holbrook1972 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. [[Joan Roughgarden]], in her book ''Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,'' postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Roughgarden2004 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=[[University of California Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC&amp;dq | isbn=0-520-24073-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-determination theory===
Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with [[self-determination theory]]. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knee C.R. |author2=Lonsbary C. |author3=Canevello A. |author4=Patrick H. | year = 2005 | title = Self-determination and conflict in romantic relationships | url = | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 89 | issue = 6| pages = 997–1009 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation.  The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunell A.B. |author2=Webster G.D. | year = 2013 | title = Self-Determination and Sexual Experience in Dating Relationships | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 970–987 | doi = 10.1177/0146167213485442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;/&gt;

According to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;/&gt; While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment.  When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;/&gt; Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females.  It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;/&gt; Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;/&gt; Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunell, A.B. 2013&quot;/&gt;

==Frequency==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2015}}
{{See also|Sexually active life expectancy}}
The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero ([[sexual abstinence]]) to 15 or 20 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Osbourne |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |title=Sexual health: An interview with a Mayo Clinic specialist |website=[[Mayo Clinic|MayoClinic.com]] |date=2 December 2004 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206023204/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |archivedate=6 December 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the US for individuals who have partners is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#frequency | title = Frequently asked questions to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction Kinsey Institute|accessdate = 6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality}}
The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].

A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fortenberry D.J. |author2=Temkit M. |author3=Tu W. |author4=Graham C.A. |author5=Katz B. | year = 2005 | title = Daily Mood, Partner Support, Sexual Interest, and Sexual Activity Among Adolescent Women | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 252–257 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257&quot;/&gt;

Although opinions differ, others{{who|date=September 2016}} suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. Sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vrangalova, Z. 2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vrangalova|first=Zhana|last2=Savin-Williams|first2=Ritch C.|date=1 August 2011|title=Adolescent sexuality and positive well-being: a group-norms approach|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=40|issue=8|pages=931–944|doi=10.1007/s10964-011-9629-7|issn=1573-6601|pmid=21274608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity according to one particular research study. In a rural upstate New York community, a cross-sectional study of teenagers was completed in 2008 and 2009. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vrangalova, Z. 2011&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vrangalova, Z. 2011&quot;/&gt;

==Health and safety==
Sexual activity is a normal physiological function,&lt;ref&gt;Xiaojun Chen, Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, [http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE|A229530831&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1 &quot; Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity&quot;], ''Medknow Publications'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity: [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancy]], contracting a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] (STI/STD), physical injury, and psychological injury.

===Unwanted pregnancy===
{{main article|Unintended pregnancy}}
Any sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx | title=Can I get pregnant if I have sex without penetration? | publisher=[[National Health Service]] | accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use [[birth control|contraception]], such as [[birth control pill]]s, a [[condom]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[spermicide]]s, [[hormonal contraception]] or sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/g/glossary.htm Dawn Stacey: Contraception. About.com.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[File:Préservatif enroulé.jpg|thumb|right|A rolled-up male [[condom]]]]
{{Main article|Sexually transmitted infection}}
Sexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected person's [[bodily fluid]]s or [[mucosal membrane]]s&lt;ref&gt;

People may not be able to detect that their [[sexual partner]] has one or more STIs, for example if they are asymptomatic (show no symptoms).&lt;ref name=&quot;King, B. 2009&quot;&gt;King, B. (2009).

Some STIs can also be contracted by using [[Drug injection|IV drug]] [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s after their use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or [[breastfeeding]].

===Aging===
{{See also|Sexuality in older age}}
Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O., &amp; Haavio-Mannila, E. The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire&quot; ''Journal of Sex Research'' 46(10), 46–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations and society==
{{main article|Sexual orientation}}

===Heterosexuality===
{{Main article|Heterosexuality}}
[[File:Bathhouse-Valerius Maximus.gif|thumb|[[Brothel]] scene in a public bath, ca. 1475]]
Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview. From FindLaw.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

===Homosexuality===
{{Main article|Homosexuality}}
[[File:An ottoman miniature from the book Sawaqub al-Manaquib depicting Homosexuality.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Ottoman miniature from the book ''Sawaqub al-Manaquib'' depicting homosexuality]]
Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.&lt;ref name=APAHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Psychology Help Center |publisher=Apahelpcenter.org |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051520/http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=WhatIsNature&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx#accordion1_content_11 What is the nature of same-sex relationships?] American Psychological Association, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in &quot;the closet&quot;). &quot;Closet case&quot; is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called &quot;[[coming out of the closet]]&quot; in the case of voluntary disclosure or &quot;[[outing]]&quot; in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called &quot;men on the DL&quot; or &quot;[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]&quot;), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the &quot;down-low&quot; may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.

People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&amp;nbsp;– [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its &quot;scissoring&quot; position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).

===Bisexuality and pansexuality===
{{Main article|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}
People who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual.&lt;ref name=&quot;apahelp&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=18 September 2012 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Other social aspects==
===General attitudes===

[[Alex Comfort]] and others propose three potential social aspects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972) by [[Alex Comfort]]. See also {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the contraceptive pill]] and other highly effective forms of [[contraception]] in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Religious and ethical===
{{Main article|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}
[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in a medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India]]
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

On the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 20 April 2004 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).

Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).

Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in sexual activities with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;case_for_swingers&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] include [[phone sex]] operators, [[strip club]]s, and pornography.

===Gender roles and the expression of sexuality===
Social [[gender roles]] can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the [[World Health Organization]] states that, &quot;Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf |title=World report on violence and health – World Health Organization |format=PDF |date=27 August 2002 |author=T.G.V. |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as those where the concepts of [[family honor]] and female [[chastity]] are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO – Female genital mutilation|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/|title=BBC – Ethics: Honour Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between [[gender equality]] and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining [[sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]], as stated by the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070817053022/http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 August 2007 |title=Paragraph 7.34 of the ICPD Programme of Action |work=Sexuality and Gender Relations |accessdate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Human sexuality and gender relations are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive lives. Equal relationships between men and women in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual respect and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour. Responsible sexual behaviour, sensitivity and equity in gender relations, particularly when instilled during the formative years, enhance and promote respectful and harmonious partnerships between men and women.&quot;

==BDSM ==
[[File:Man Cuffed to Bedrail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A man handcuffed to a bed and blindfolded]]
[[File:Sketched Nude with Tied Wrists.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sketch of a nude woman with tied wrists]]
BDSM is a variety of [[Eroticism|erotic]] practices or [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[dominance and submission]], [[sadomasochism]], and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on [[self-identification]] and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or [[rubber fetishism|rubber aficionados]], and others.

B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perks, problems, and the people who play: A qualitative exploration of dominant and submissive BDSM roles|url = http://www.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.3138%2Fcjhs.2467|journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|date = 1 January 2015|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2467|first = Ali|last = Hébert|first2 = Angela|last2 = Weaver|pages=49–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/S means &quot;dominant and submissive.&quot; A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; S/M (sadism and masochism) means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Unlike the usual &quot;power neutral&quot; relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[informed consent]] of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]].

Individuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a &quot;dom&quot; for a man or a woman.  Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term &quot;Domme&quot;.  Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken.  Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as ''switches''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot; mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Submissivepup.jpg|thumb]]
In a 2013 study, the researchers suggest that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,
use suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/jsm.12192|journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date = 1 January 2013|volume = 10|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192|first = Andreas A.J.|last = Wismeijer|first2 = Marcel A.L.M. van|last2 = Assen|pages=1943–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicates that, in the past, BDSM has been seen as maladaptive to one's psychological health, but that this may be incorrect. According to the study, one who participates in BDSM can have greater strength socially, mentally and have greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; It states that people who participate in BDSM play actually have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all consensual and pleasurable to both parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

In a 2015 study, BDSM relationships were suggested to have a higher level of connection, intimacy, trust and communication compared to individuals who do not practice BDSM.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. They mention that both parties enjoys pleasing their partner in any way they can. Submissive and Dominants who participated in their research, felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. Their findings suggest that submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. BDSM was also suggested to improve personal growth, romantic relationships, their sense of community, their sense of self, the dominants confidence, and help an individual cope with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{Main article|Sex and the law}}
There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.

Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.

===Same-sex laws===

Many locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].

===Sex outside marriage===
In the West, sex before marriage is not illegal. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex.

Other studies have analyzed the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage.

===Minimum age of sexual activity (age of consent)===
{{Main article|Age of consent}}
The laws of each jurisdiction set the minimum age at which a young person is allowed to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Waites| first = Matthew|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn= 1-4039-2173-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[age of consent]] is typically between 14 and 18 years, but laws vary.

Age of consent may vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incestuous relationships===
Most jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called [[incest]]uous.

===Sexual abuse===
{{Main article|Sexual abuse|Rape|Sexual assault}}

Non-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of [[sexual abuse]], as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as &quot;[[indecent exposure]]&quot; and &quot;[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]&quot; respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lawrence Greenfeld |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF |format=PDF |title=Sex Offenses and Offenders |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=6 February 1997 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution and survival sex===
{{main article|Prostitution}}
People sometimes exchange sex for money or access to other resources. This practice, called prostitution, takes place under many varied circumstances. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including (and most commonly) &quot;john.&quot; Prostitution is one of the branches of the [[sex industry]]. The [[prostitution and the law|legal status of prostitution]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]], from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over $100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes referred to as &quot;the world's oldest profession&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The prostitution of women and girls – Page 5; Ronald B. Flowers – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution may be a voluntary individual activity or facilitated or [[forced prostitution|forced]] by [[pimp]]s.

[[Survival sex]] is a form of prostitution engaged in by people in need, usually when [[homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged people trade sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

[[Image:DSCN3606-hydraulic-ram.JPG|thumb|right|Figure&amp;nbsp;1: A hydraulic ram that drives a fountain at the [[Centre for Alternative Technology]]]]

A '''hydraulic ram''', or '''hydram''', is a [[cyclic pump|cyclic water pump]] powered by [[hydropower]].  It takes in water at one &quot;[[hydraulic head]]&quot; (pressure) and flow rate, and outputs water at a higher hydraulic head and lower flow rate. The device uses the [[water hammer]] effect to develop pressure that allows a portion of the input water that powers the [[pump]] to be lifted to a point higher than where the water originally started. The hydraulic ram is sometimes used in remote areas, where there is both a source of [[Low head hydro power|low-head hydropower]] and a need for pumping water to a destination higher in elevation than the source.  In this situation, the ram is often useful, since it requires no outside source of [[Power (physics)|power]] other than the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water.

== History ==
[[File:Ram Pump (Vogn 2011) ubt.ogv|thumb|A ram pump in [[Vogn]], [[North Denmark Region|Nordjylland]], [[Denmark]]]]

In 1772, [[John Whitehurst]] of [[Cheshire]], [[United Kingdom]], invented a manually controlled precursor of the hydraulic ram called the &quot;pulsation engine&quot; and installed the first one at [[Oulton, Cheshire]] to raise water to a height of {{convert|4.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions of Whitehurst's and Montgolfier's pumps appear in: James Ferguson and David Brewster, ''Lectures on Select Subjects'', 3rd ed. (Edinburgh, Scotland: Stirling &amp; Slade, etc., 1823), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NrYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 287-292]; plates, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, he installed another in [[Ireland]]. He did not [[patent]] it, and details are obscure, but it is known to have had an air vessel.

The first self-acting ram [[pump]] was invented by the Frenchman [[Montgolfier brothers|Joseph Michel Montgolfier]] (best known as a co-inventor of the [[hot air balloon]]) in 1796 for raising water in his [[paper mill]] at [[Voiron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Montgolfier|first=J.M.|title=Note sur le bélier hydraulique, et sur la manière d'en calculer les effets|trans-title=Note on the hydraulic ram, and on the method of calculating its effects|url=http://annales.ensmp.fr/articles/1802-1803-1/32-38.pdf|work=Journal des Mines, 13 (73)|pages=42–51|language=French|format=PDF|year=1803}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Matthew Boulton]] took out a British patent on his behalf in 1797. The sons of Montgolfier obtained a British patent for an improved version in 1816,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGQ7AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;New Patents: Pierre François Montgolfier,&quot;] ''The Annals of Philosophy'', '''7''' (41) : 405 (May 1816).&lt;/ref&gt; and this was acquired, together with Whitehurst's design, in 1820 by [[Josiah Easton]], a [[Somerset]]-born engineer who had just moved to London.

Easton's firm, inherited by his son [[James Easton|James]] (1796–1871), grew during the nineteenth century to become one of the more important engineering manufacturers in the United Kingdom, with a large works at [[Erith]], [[Kent]]. They specialised in water supply and [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] systems worldwide, as well as land [[drainage]] projects. Eastons had a good business supplying rams for water supply purposes to large [[English country house|country house]]s, farms, and village communities. Some of their installations still survived as of 2004, one such example being at the hamlet of Toller Whelme, in Dorset.

The firm closed in 1909, but the ram business was continued by [[James R Easton]]. In 1929, it was acquired by Green &amp; Carter{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} &lt;!--Company's own web site is not a reliable reference --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenandcarter.com/ Green and Carter – Hydraulic Ram Pump inventors and patentees.]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]], who were engaged in the manufacturing and installation of [[Vulcan ram|Vulcan]] and [[Vacher]] Rams.

Available on-line at: [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-02-02-0267-0002 U.S. National Archives].&lt;/ref&gt; US interest in hydraulic rams picked up around 1840, as further patents were issued and domestic companies started offering rams for sale. Toward the end of the 19th century, interest waned as [[electricity]] and electric pumps became widely available.

By the end of the twentieth century interest in hydraulic rams has revived, due to the needs of [[sustainable technology]] in [[developing countries]], and [[energy conservation]] in developed ones. A good example is [http://www.aidfi.org/ AID Foundation International] in the Philippines, who won an [[Ashden Award]] for their work developing ram pumps that could be easily maintained for use in remote villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =AID Foundation 2007 Ashden Award| date = |url = http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/aidfoundation| accessdate =2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydraulic ram principle has been used in some proposals for exploiting [[wave power]], one of which was discussed as long ago as 1931 by [[Walter de Haas|Hanns Günther]] in his book ''In hundert Jahren''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In hundert Jahren | author = Hanns G&amp;uuml;nther (Walter de Haas) | year = 1931 | publisher = Kosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later ram designs in the UK called '''compound rams''' were designed to pump treated water using an untreated drive water source, which overcomes some of the problems of having drinking water sourced from an open stream.&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation board at the [[Lost Gardens of Heligan]], Cornwall&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Papa hydraulic ram pump.jpg|thumb|Principles of operation of the Papa hydraulic ram pump]]
In 1996 an English engineer, Frederick Philip Selwyn, patented a ‘fluid pressure amplifier’ which differed in many ways to the contemporary ram technology by the development of a [[venturi effect]] waste valve.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Philip Selwyn, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=06206041&amp;PageNum=1&amp;&amp;IDKey=033A8E0EA73A&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526d=PALL%2526S1=6206041.PN.%2526OS=PN/6206041%2526RS=PN/6206041 pdfpiw.uspto.gov], &quot;Fluid pressure amplifier&quot;, U.S. Patent no. 6,206,041 (filed: 2 April 1997; issued: 27 March 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low pressure generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped [[elastomeric]] valve (with low pressure loss) to allow a valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting in line with the supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non return valve. The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A [[pressure vessel]] installed on a tee connected to the delivery port of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.

Additional patents granted to Selwyn have since been developed by UK companies Papa Ltd and Water Powered Technologies Ltd&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.waterpoweredtechnologies.com/ Water Powered Technologies – Composite Hydraulic Ram Pump inventors and patentees.]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bude]], [[Cornwall]], further enhancing the technology to include a [[composite material]] [[injection-moulded]] pump allowing for relatively low cost [[mass production]] whilst maintaining high strength, low weight and high performance previously only attainable with metal units.

Other novel developments include an automatic regulator valve which can be simply installed to the pumps to allow the maximum utilisation of water supply from low or seasonally variable water sources without the need to manually adjust the pumps - as well as much larger pump versions with 1 metre diameter inlets for large river, marine tidal and flood applications. Systems have also been developed and utilised for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water treatment]] and other [[water utility]] applications.

The new [[scalable]] technology, manufacturing processes and materials and the ability to integrate with other systems should allow the 21st century ram pump to regain its recognition as a world leader in energy efficient water supply as well as new roles in energy generation, irrigation and flood support networks.{{clear}}

== Construction and principle of operation ==
A traditional hydraulic ram has only two moving parts, a spring or weight loaded &quot;waste&quot; [[valve]] sometimes known as the &quot;clack&quot; valve and a &quot;delivery&quot; [[check valve]], making it cheap to build, easy to maintain, and very reliable. The Papa hydraulic ram pump also has only two moving parts. However, these are not mechanical but instead rely on the elastomeric properties of the main valve and non-return valve which are low-cost, reliable and easy to replace. In addition, there is a drive pipe supplying water from an elevated source and a delivery pipe, taking a portion of the water that comes through the drive pipe to an elevation higher than the source.

=== Sequence of operation ===
[[Image:Hydraulic Ram.gif|thumb|right|250px|Figure&amp;nbsp;2: Basic components of a hydraulic ram:&lt;br&gt;
1. Inlet – drive pipe&lt;br&gt;
2. Free flow at waste valve&lt;br&gt;
3. Outlet – delivery pipe&lt;br&gt;
4. Waste valve&lt;br&gt;
5. Delivery [[check valve]]&lt;br&gt;
6. Pressure vessel]]
A simplified hydraulic ram is shown in Figure&amp;nbsp;2. Initially, the waste valve [4] is open (i.e. lowered) because of its own weight, and the delivery valve [5] is closed under the pressure caused by the water column from the outlet [3]. The water in the inlet pipe [1] starts to flow under the force of [[gravity]] and picks up speed and [[kinetic energy]] until the increasing [[Drag (physics)|drag]] force lifts the waste valve's weight and closes it. The [[momentum]] of the water flow in the inlet pipe against the now closed waste valve causes a [[water hammer]] that raises the pressure in the pump beyond the pressure caused by the water column pressing down from the outlet. This pressure differential now opens the delivery valve [5], and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe [3]. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve [5] closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the inlet pipe to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the inlet pipe. This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.

A pressure vessel [6] containing air cushions the hydraulic pressure shock when the waste valve closes, and it also improves the pumping efficiency by allowing a more constant flow through the delivery pipe. Although the pump could in theory work without it, the efficiency would drop drastically and the pump would be subject to extraordinary stresses that could shorten its life considerably. One problem is that the pressurized air will gradually dissolve into the water until none remains. One solution to this problem is to have the air separated from the water by an elastic diaphragm (similar to an [[expansion tank]]); however, this solution can be problematic in developing countries where replacements are difficult to procure. Another solution is to have a mechanism such as a [[snifting valve]] that automatically inserts a small bubble of air when the suction pulse described above reaches the pump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalactionconsulting.org/docs/technical_information_service/hydraulic_ram_pumps.pdf Practical Answers: Hydraulic Ram Pumps]&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution is to insert an [[inner tube]] of a car or bicycle [[tire]] into the pressure vessel with some air in it and the valve closed. This tube is in effect the same as the diaphragm, but it is implemented with more widely available materials. The air in the tube cushions the shock of the water the same as the air in other configurations does.

===Efficiency===
A typical energy efficiency is 60%, but up to 80% is possible. This should not be confused with the volumetric efficiency, which relates the volume of water delivered to total water taken from the source.  The portion of water available at the delivery pipe will be reduced by the ratio of the delivery head to the supply head.  Thus if the source is 2 meters above the ram and the water is lifted to 10 meters above the ram, only 20% of the supplied water can be available, the other 80% being spilled via the waste valve.  These ratios assume 100% energy efficiency.  Actual water delivered will be further reduced by the energy efficiency factor. In the above example, if the energy efficiency is 70%, the water delivered will be 70% of 20%, i.e. 14%.  Assuming a 2-to-1 supply head to delivery head ratio and 70% efficiency, the delivered water would be 70% of 50%, i.e. 35%.  Very high ratios of delivery to supply head usually result in lowered energy efficiency.  Suppliers of rams often provide tables giving expected volume ratios based on actual tests.

===Drive and delivery pipe design===
Since both efficiency and reliable cycling depend on water hammer effects, the drive pipe design is important. It should be between 3 and 7 times longer than the vertical distance between the source and the ram. Commercial rams may have an input fitting designed to accommodate this optimum [[slope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenandcarter.com/main/rampumpleaflet.htm Hydraulic Ram Pumps, John Perkin]&lt;/ref&gt; The diameter of the supply pipe would normally match  the diameter of  the input fitting on the ram, which in turn is based on its pumping capacity.  The drive pipe should be of constant diameter and material, and should be as straight as possible.  Where bends are necessary, they should be smooth, large diameter curves. Even a large spiral is allowed, but [[Elbow (piping)|elbows]] are to be avoided. PVC will work in some installations, but steel pipe is preferred, although much more expensive. If valves are used they should be a free flow type such as a [[ball valve]] or [[gate valve]].

The delivery pipe is much less critical since the pressure vessel prevents water hammer effects from traveling up it. Its overall design would be determined by the allowable [[pressure drop]] based on the expected flow. Typically the pipe size will be about half that of the supply pipe, but for very long runs a larger size may be indicated. PVC pipe and any necessary valves are not a problem.

=== Starting operation ===
A ram newly placed into operation or which has stopped cycling must be started as follows.  If the waste valve is in the raised (closed) position, which is most common, it must be pushed down  manually into the open position and released. If the flow is sufficient, it will then cycle at least once.  If it does not continue to cycle, it must be pushed down repeatedly until it cycles continuously on its own, usually after three or four manual cycles. If the ram stops with the waste valve in the down (open) position it must be lifted manually and kept up for as long as necessary for the supply pipe to fill with water and for any air bubbles to travel up the pipe to the source. This may take a minute or more.  Then it can be started manually by pushing it down a few times as described above. Having a valve on the delivery pipe at the ram makes starting easier.  Close the valve until the ram starts cycling, then gradually open it to fill the delivery pipe. If opened too quickly it will stop the cycling. Once the delivery pipe is full the valve can be left open.

=== Common operational problems ===
Failure to deliver sufficient water may be due to improper adjustment of the waste valve, having too little air in the pressure vessel, or simply attempting to raise the water higher than the level of which the ram is capable.

The ram may be damaged by freezing in winter, or loss of air in the pressure vessel leading to excess stress on the ram parts.   These failures will require welding or other repair methods and perhaps parts replacement.

It is not uncommon for an operating ram to require occasional restarts. The cycling may stop due to poor adjustment of the waste valve, or insufficient water flow at the source.  Air can enter if the supply water level is not at least a few inches above the input end of the supply pipe.  Other problems are blockage of the valves with debris, or improper installation, such as using a supply pipe of non uniform diameter or material, having sharp bends or a rough interior, or one that is too long or short for the drop, or is made of an insufficiently rigid material.  A PVC supply pipe will work in some installations but is not as optimal as steel.

== Water-powered pump ==
An alternative to the hydraulic ram is the water-powered pump. It can be used if a high flow rate at high head ratio is required. A water-powered pump unit is a hydraulic turbine coupled to a water pump. The motive power needed by the pump is generated by the hydraulic turbine from the available low head water energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789354/Nagarjuna-Sagar-WPP-Units Nagarjuna Sagar Water Powered pump (WPP) Units]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homininae''' is a subfamily of [[Hominidae]]. It includes two tribes, with their [[extant taxon|extant]] as well as extinct species: the [[Hominini]] tribe (with the genus ''[[Homo]]'' including modern [[humans]], [[Australopithecina]], comprising at least three extinct (or, fossil) genera and the genus ''Pan'' including [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s), and the [[Gorillini]] tribe ([[gorilla]]s). It comprises all [[hominids]] that arose after orangutans (subfamily [[Ponginae]]) split from the line of great apes. The Homininae [[cladogram]] has three main branches, which lead to gorillas (through the tribe Gorillini), and to humans and chimpanzees via the tribe Hominini and subtribes Hominina and Panina (see the evolutionary tree below). There are two living species of Panina (chimpanzees and bonobos) and two living species of gorillas, but only one extant human species. Traces of hypothetical ''Homo'' species, including ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' and ''[[Homo denisova]]'', have been found with dates as recent as 40,000 years ago. Organisms in this class are described as '''hominine''' or '''hominines''' (not to be confused with the terms [[hominin]]s or [[hominini]]).

==History of discoveries and classification==
{{See also|List of human evolution fossils}}
[[File:Homininae.svg|left|frame|[[Evolutionary tree]] of the superfamily [[Hominoidea]], emphasizing the subfamily Homininae: after an initial separation from the main line (some 18 million years ago) of [[Hylobatidae]] (current [[gibbon]]s), the line of subfamily [[Ponginae]] broke away—leading to the current [[orangutan]]; and later the Homininae split into the tribe [[Hominini]] (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe [[Gorillini]].]]

Until 1980, the family (and term) Hominidae meant humans only; the non-human [[great ape]]s were assigned to the family [[Pongidae]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Goodman |authorlink=Morris Goodman |chapter = Man’s place in the phylogeny of the primates as reflected in serum proteins |pages = 204–234 |editor-first=S.L. |editor-last=Washburn |title=Classification and Human Evolution |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8NHbEwLkYmQC&amp;pg=PA204 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-202-36487-2 |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later discoveries led to revised classifications, with the great apes then united with humans (now in subfamily Homininae) as members of family Hominidae &lt;ref name=Goodman1&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 3 | pages = 203–228 | year = 1974 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.an.03.100174.001223 | title = Biochemical Evidence on Hominid Phylogeny | first = M. |last=Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further discoveries indicated that gorillas and chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to orangutans, leading to their (gorillas and chimpanzees) placement in subfamily Homininae as well.&lt;ref name=Goodman2&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | year = 1990 | volume = 30 | pages = 260–6 | title = Primate evolution at the DNA level and a classification of hominoids |author1=Goodman M. |author2=Tagle D.A. |author3=Fitch D.H. |author4=Bailey W. |author5=Czelusniak J. |author6=Koop B.F. |author7=Benson P. |author8=Slightom J.L. | doi = 10.1007/BF02099995 | pmid = 2109087 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subfamily Homininae can be further subdivided into three branches: the tribe [[Gorillini]] (gorillas), and the tribe [[Hominini]] with subtribes [[Chimpanzee|Panina]] (chimpanzees) and [[Hominina]] (humans and their extinct relatives). The [[Late Miocene]] fossil ''[[Nakalipithecus nakayamai]]'', described in 2007, is a [[basal (evolution)|basal]] member of this [[clade]], as is, perhaps, its contemporary ''[[Ouranopithecus]]''; that is, they are not assignable to any of the three extant branches. Their existence suggests that the Homininae tribes diverged not earlier than about 8 million years ago (see [[Human evolutionary genetics]]).

Today, chimpanzees and gorillas live in tropical forests with acid soils that rarely preserve fossils. Although no fossil gorillas have been reported, four chimpanzee teeth about 500,000 years old have been discovered in the East-African rift valley ([[Kapthurin]] Formation, Kenya), where many fossils from the human lineage (hominins)&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;A ''hominin'' is a member of the tribe Hominini, a ''hominine'' is a member of the subfamily Homininae, a ''hominid'' is a member of the family Hominidae, and a ''hominoid'' is a member of the superfamily Hominoidea.&lt;/ref&gt; have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McBrearty S, Jablonski N |title=First fossil chimpanzee |year=2005 |pmid=16136135 |doi=10.1038/nature04008 |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=105–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that some chimpanzees lived close to ''Homo'' (''[[H. erectus]]'' or ''[[H. rhodesiensis]]'') at the time; the same is likely true for gorillas. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Evolution of bipedalism===
{{see also|Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism}}
Recent studies of ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' (4.4 million years old) and ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' (6 million years old) suggest some degree of bipedalism. ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and early ''[[Paranthropus]]'' may have been [[bipedal]]. Very early hominins such as ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kivell TL, Schmitt D |title=Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor |journal=Proc.

===Brain size evolution===
There has been a gradual increase in brain volume ([[brain size]]) as the ancestors of modern humans progressed along the [[timeline of human evolution]], starting from about 600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in ''[[Homo habilis]]'' up to 1500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. However, modern ''Homo sapiens'' have a brain volume slightly smaller (1250&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) than Neanderthals, women have a brain slightly smaller than men and the Flores hominids (''[[Homo floresiensis]]''), nicknamed hobbits, had a cranial capacity of about 380&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (considered small for a chimpanzee), about a third of the ''[[Homo erectus]]'' average. It is proposed that they evolved from ''H. erectus'' as a case of insular dwarfism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In spite of their smaller brain, there is evidence that ''H. floresiensis'' used fire and made stone tools at least as sophisticated as those of their proposed ancestors ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Brown P, Sutikna T, Morwood MJ, etal |title=A new small-bodied hominin from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7012 |pages=1055–61 |year=2004 |pmid=15514638 |doi=10.1038/nature02999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it seems that for intelligence, the structure of the brain is more important than its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=I. |chapter=As large as you need and as small as you can—implications of the brain size of ''Homo floresiensis'' |chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/218472/_As_large_as_you_need_and_as_small_as_you_can—implications_of_the_brain_size_of_Homo_floresiensis_ |editor-first=A.C. |editor-last=Schalley |editor2-first=D. |editor2-last=Khlentzos |title=Mental States: Evolution, function, nature; 2.

===Evolution of family structure and sexuality===
{{see also|Human sexuality}}
Sexuality is related to family structure and partly shapes it. The involvement of fathers in education is quite unique to humans, at least when compared to other Homininae. [[Concealed ovulation]] and [[menopause]] in women both also occur in a few other primates however, but are uncommon in other species. [[Testis]] and [[penis size]] seems to be related to family structure: [[monogamy]] or [[promiscuity]], or [[harem]], in humans, chimpanzees or gorillas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared |authorlink=Jared M. Diamond|title=[[The Third Chimpanzee]]|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WiSF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared|title=[[Why is Sex Fun?]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels of [[sexual dimorphism]] are generally seen as a marker of [[sexual selection]]. Studies have suggested that the earliest hominins were dimorphic and that this lessened over the course of the evolution of the genus ''Homo'', correlating with humans becoming more monogamous, whereas gorillas, who live in harems, show a large degree of sexual dimorphism. Concealed (or &quot;hidden&quot;) ovulation means that the phase of fertility is not detectable in women, whereas chimpanzees advertise ovulation via an obvious swelling of the genitals. Women can be partly aware of their ovulation along the menstrual phases, but men are essentially unable to detect ovulation in women. Most primates have semi-concealed ovulation, thus one can think that the common ancestor had semi-concealed ovulation, that was inherited by gorillas, and that later evolved in concealed ovulation in humans and advertised ovulation in chimpanzees. Menopause also occurs in [[rhesus monkeys]], and possibly in chimpanzees, but does not in gorillas and is quite uncommon in other primates (and other mammal groups).&lt;ref name=&quot;WiSF&quot;/&gt;

'''''Homo habilis''''' was a [[species]] of the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Hominini]], during the [[Gelasian]] and early [[Calabrian (stage)|Calabrian]] stages of the [[Pleistocene]] geological epoch, which lived between roughly 2.1 and 1.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;

This date range overlaps with the emergence of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/09/science/08cnd-fossil.html?ref=science New York Times] article ''Fossils in Kenya Challenge Linear Evolution'' published August 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The type specimen is [[OH 7]], discovered in 1960 at [[Olduvai Gorge]] in Tanzania, associated with the [[Oldowan]] lithic industry; the fossils were identified as a separate species of ''Homo'' with the proposed binomial name of ''H. habilis'' (&quot;[[:wikt:habilis|handy]] man&quot;) in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 2014. pp 31-33&quot;&gt;Wood, Bernard &quot;Fifty Years After ''Homo habilis''&quot;, ''Nature''. 3 April 2014. pp 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;
In its appearance and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], ''H. habilis'' is the least similar to modern humans of all species in the genus ''Homo'' (except the equally controversial ''[[H. rudolfensis]]''), and its classification as ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' has been the subject of controversial debate since its first proposal in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Collard and Bernard Wood, [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-39979-4_51 Defining the Genus ''Homo'']; 2015 ; quote p2137: &quot;Wood and Collard’s (1999) proposal to remove ''H. habilis'' and ''H. rudolfensis'' from ''Homo'' and assign them to a different genus or pair of genera remains valid.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LD 350-1]] is a fossil jawbone fragment discovered in 2013, which has been dated to 2.8 million years ago and argued to be intermediate between ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and ''H. habilis''.&lt;ref name=Villmoare15&gt;

[[Louis Leakey]] (father of Richard Leakey), the British-Kenyan paleoanthropologist who was the first to suggest the existence of ''H. habilis'', and his wife, Mary Leakey, found the first trace of ''H. habilis'' in 1955: two hominin teeth. These were later classified as &quot;milk teeth&quot;, and therefore considered difficult to link to taxa, unlike permanent teeth. However, in 1959, Mary Leakey recovered the cranium of a young adult that had a small brain, large face, tiny canines and massive chewing teeth (which earned it the nickname of &quot;The Nutcracker man&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 2014. pp 31-33&quot;/&gt;

''H. habilis'' was short and had disproportionately long arms compared to modern humans; however, it had a less protruding face than the [[australopithecine]]s from which it is thought to have descended. ''H. habilis'' had a [[cranial capacity]] slightly less than half of the size of modern humans. Despite the ape-like morphology of the bodies, ''H. habilis'' remains are often accompanied by primitive [[stone tools]] (e.g. [[Olduvai Gorge]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Lake Turkana]], [[Kenya]]).

''Homo habilis'' has often been thought to be the ancestor of the more [[Gracility|gracile]] and sophisticated ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', which in turn gave rise to the more human-appearing species, ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Debates continue over whether all of the known fossils are properly attributed to the species, and some paleoanthropologists regard the taxon as invalid, made up of fossil specimens of ''Australopithecus'' and ''Homo''.&lt;ref&gt;Tattersall, I. &amp; Schwartz, J.H., ''Extinct Humans'', Westview Press, New York, 2001, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; New findings in 2007 seemed to confirm the view that ''H. habilis'' and ''H. erectus'' coexisted, representing separate lineages from a common ancestor instead of ''H. erectus'' being descended from ''H. habilis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Implications of new early ''Homo'' fossils from Ileret, east of Lake Turkana, Kenya|author1=F.

''H. habilis''' brain capacity of around 640&amp;nbsp;cm³ was on average 50% larger than [[australopithecine]]s, but considerably smaller than the 1350 to 1450&amp;nbsp;cm³ range of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. These [[Hominini|hominins]] were smaller than modern humans, on average standing no more than 1.3&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft 3 in) tall.

A fragment of fossilized jawbone, dated to around 2.8 million years ago, was discovered in the Ledi-Geraru research area in [[Afar Region|Afar Regional State]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=Villmoare15/&gt; 
The fossil is considered the earliest evidence of the ''Homo'' genus known to date, and seems to be intermediate between ''Australopithecus'' and ''H. habilis''.

&lt;!--This contradicts both the source of Note 1 and other information in the article. But here it is if you can back it up with sources: Anthropologist [[Louis Leakey]]’s son [[Jonathan Leakey]], unearthed an [[ape]]-like skull that shared [[human]]-like traits in 1964. The name itself, ''Homo habilis'', was originally given by [[Raymond Dart]]. --&gt;
Locomotor affinities of OH 62 have been assessed primarily on the basis of its forelimb to hind limb proportions, which are known to be associated with locomotor behavior among living primates. Initial analyses concentrated on comparisons to the ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' A.L. 288-1 (&quot;[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]&quot;). In most dimensions—measured or estimated—the OH 62 upper limb remains equaled or exceeded those of A.L. 288-1, while its lower limb remains (principally the femur) appeared to be smaller. In particular, using a length estimate for the humerus of 264 mm, and a length estimate for the less complete femur of ‘‘no greater than that of A.L. 288-1 (280 mm),&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; a possible humerofemoral length index is close to 95%, which is more like that of modern chimpanzees (averaging about 1.00) than modern humans (averaging about 0.72). In this sense, it was more ‘‘primitive&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; than A.L. 288-1, with a length index of 0.85.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Relative Limb Strength and Locomotion in ''Homo habilis''&quot;, Ruff, Christopher, ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'', 138:90–100 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===KNM ER 1813===
[[KNM ER 1813]] is a relatively complete [[cranium]], which dates to 1.9 million years old, discovered at [[Koobi Fora]], Kenya by [[Kamoya Kimeu]] in 1973. The brain capacity is 510&amp;nbsp;cm³, not as impressive as other early specimen and forms of ''H. habilis'' discovered.

===OH 24===
[[OH 24]] (''Twiggy'') is a roughly deformed cranium about 1.8 million years old discovered in October 1968 at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The brain volume is just under 600&amp;nbsp;cm³; also, a reduction in the protruding face is present compared to members of more primitive australopithecines.

===OH 7===
[[OH 7]] dates to 1.75 million years old, and was discovered by Mary and Louis Leakey on November 4, 1960 at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. It is a lower jaw complete with teeth; due to the size of the small teeth, researchers estimate this juvenile individual had a brain volume of 363&amp;nbsp;cm³. Also found were more than 20 fragments of the left hand. Tobias and Napier assisted in classifying OH 7 as the type fossil.

The OH 7 hand of ''Homo habilis'' combines traits associated with a precision grip and adaptations related to climbing, which fits well with the semi-long, humanlike hindlimb proportions and a rather chimpanzee-like upper-to-lower arm ratio.

===KNM ER 1805===
[[KNM ER 1805]] is a specimen of an adult ''H. habilis'' made of three pieces of cranium dating to 1.74 million years old from Koobi Fora, Kenya. Previous assumptions were that this specimen belongs to ''H. erectus'' based on the degree of [[prognathism]] and overall cranial shape.

== Diet ==
Based on dental microwear-texture analysis, ''Homo habilis'' (as well as other early ''Homo''-class hominins) likely did not specialize on particularly tough foods. Microwear-texture complexity is, on average, somewhere between that of tough-food feeders and leaf feeders (folivores.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ungar|first=Peter|date=February 9, 2012|title=Dental Evidence for the Reconstruction of Diet in African Early ''Homo''|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|pages=S318–S329|doi=10.1086/666700|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = 2015-11-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements are analyses of the percentages of tooth surface structure containing &quot;pits&quot; (frequency and depth of dental damage resulting from consumption of certain foods across species). It is a heavily used, and henceforth widely accepted as reliable, measure of wear that a species, on average, endures from eating certain food. These measurements point to an increasingly generalized, and generally omnivorous diet in ''Homo habilis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dental Microwear and Diets of African Early ''Homo''|last = Ungar|first = Peter|date =January 1, 2006|journal = Journal of Human Evolution|doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.08.007|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Grine|first2 = Frederick|last3 = Teaford|first3 = Mark|last4 = Zaatari|first4 = Sireen |volume=50 |pages=78–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Image:Homo habilis.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Artistic interpretation of ''Homo habilis'' at the Westfälisches Museum für Archäologie, Herne]]
''Homo habilis'' is thought to have mastered the Lower Paleolithic [[Olduwan|Olduwan tool set]], which used stone flakes. ''H. habilis'' used these stones to butcher and skin the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together, Worlds Apart|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = 500 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10110|pages = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stone flakes were more advanced than any tools previously used, and gave ''H. habilis'' the edge it needed to prosper in hostile environments previously too formidable for [[primate]]s. Whether ''H. habilis'' was the first hominin to master stone tool technology remains controversial, as ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'', dated to 2.6 million years ago, has been found along with stone tool implements.
[[File:Homo habilis - forensic facial reconstruction.png|thumb|left|200px|''Homo habilis'' – Forensic facial approximation]]
''Homo habilis''’ fore-to-hindlimb joint size resembles a more primitive ''A. afarensis'', which is less similar to humans; this suggests that maybe ''Homo sapiens'' aren’t as similar to ''Homo habilis'' as proposed. The body proportions for ''H. habilis'' are in accordance with craniodental evidence, suggesting closer association with ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Body Proportions of Homo Habilis Reviewed,'' Martin Haeusler, ''Journal of Human Evolution'', Vol 46, Issue 4, p 433-465, pub APR 2004
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most experts assume the intelligence and social organization of ''H. habilis'' were more sophisticated than typical australopithecines or [[chimpanzee]]s. ''H. habilis'' used tools primarily for scavenging, such as cleaving meat off carrion, rather than defense or hunting. Yet, despite tool usage, ''H. habilis'' was not the master hunter its sister species (or descendants) proved to be, as ample fossil evidence indicates ''H. habilis'' was a staple in the diet of large predatory animals, such as ''[[Dinofelis]]'', a large scimitar-toothed predatory [[Felidae|cat]] the size of a [[jaguar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/01/0102_020107maneater.html |title= Killer Cats Hunted Human Ancestors |work= National Geographic News |author= Hillary Mayell
|accessdate= 2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Homo habilis'' coexisted with other ''Homo''-like bipedal primates, such as ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'', some of which prospered for many millennia. However, ''H. habilis'', possibly because of its early tool innovation and a less specialized diet, became the precursor of an entire line of new species, whereas ''Paranthropus boisei'' and its [[robust australopithecine|robust relatives]] disappeared from the fossil record. ''H. habilis'' may also have coexisted with ''H. erectus'' in Africa for a period of 500,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[BBC News]] |title = Finds test human origins theory |author=Urquhart, James |date=August 8, 2007 |accessdate=July 27, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6937476.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''harmonica''', also known as a '''French harp''' or '''[[mouth organ]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = B | last = Willy | title = Harmonica 101 | url = http://www.davidpatrone.com/Literature/Harmonica101.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011210618/http://davidpatrone.com/Literature/Harmonica101.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[free reed aerophone|free reed]] [[wind instrument]] used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in [[blues]], [[American folk music revival|American folk music]], [[classical music]], [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], and [[rock and roll]]. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one [[Reed (music)|reed]]. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of [[brass]], [[stainless steel]], or [[bronze]], which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.

Reeds are pre-tuned to individual pitches. Tuning may involve changing a reeds length, the weight near its free end, or the stiffness near its fixed end. Longer, heavier and springier reeds produce deeper, lower sounds; shorter, lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds. If, as on most modern harmonicas, a reed is affixed above or below its slot rather than in the plane of the slot, it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot, i.e., as a ''closing reed''. This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a ''blow reed'' and a ''draw reed'' in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather (valves, wind-savers) to block the nonplaying reed.

An important technique in performance is bending: causing a drop in pitch by making [[embouchure]] adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonica Bending Reference|url=http://www.harmonica.com/bending|publisher=Harmonica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to bend isolated reeds, as on chromatic and other harmonica models with wind-savers, but also to both lower, and raise (''overbend'', ''overblow'', ''overdraw''&lt;ref&gt;[http://overblow.com/index.php?menuid=135 Harmonica - Harp Modifications]&lt;/ref&gt;) the pitch produced by pairs of reeds in the same chamber, as on a diatonic or other unvalved harmonica. Such two-reed pitch changes actually involve sound production by the normally silent reed, the ''opening reed'' (for instance, the blow reed while the player is drawing).

==Parts==
[[Image:Gaita partes1.jpg|thumb|200px|Comb and two reed plates]]
[[Image:Gaita palhetas.jpg|thumb|200px|Reed plate]]
[[Image:Gaita Palhetas2.jpg|thumb|200px|Reed plate mounted on the comb of a diatonic harmonica, one of several categories of harmonica.]] The basic parts of the harmonica are the comb, reed plates and cover plates.

===Comb===
The comb is the main body of the instrument, which, when assembled with the reedplates, forms air chambers for the reeds. The term ''comb'' may originate from the similarity between this part of a harmonica and a [[hair comb]]. Harmonica combs were traditionally made from [[wood]] but now are also made from [[plastic]] ([[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]]) or [[metal]] (including [[titanium]] for high-end instruments).&lt;ref name=mid&gt;&quot;[http://middlebury.net/interesting/lavoie.html Mark Lavoie – Harmonica Player ... and more],&quot; ''The Middlebury Community Network''&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern and experimental comb designs are complex in the way that they direct the air.

There is dispute among players about whether comb material affects the tone of a harmonica. Those saying no argue that, unlike the soundboard of a piano or the top piece of a violin or guitar, a harmonica's comb is neither large enough nor able to vibrate freely enough to substantially augment or change the sound. Among those saying yes are those who are convinced by their ears. Few dispute, however, that comb surface smoothness and air-tightness when mated with the reedplates can greatly affect tone and playability. The main advantage of a particular comb material over another one is its durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinstein, Randy F. |author2=Melton, William|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing the Harmonica|isbn=0-02-864241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a wooden comb can absorb moisture from the player's breath and contact with the tongue. This can cause the comb to expand slightly, making the instrument uncomfortable to play, and to then contract, potentially compromising air tightness. Various types of wood and treatments have been devised to reduce the degree of this problem.&lt;ref name=mid/&gt;

An even more serious problem with wood combs, especially in chromatic harmonicas (with their thin dividers between chambers), is that, as the combs expand and shrink over time, cracks can form in the combs, because the comb is held immobile by nails, resulting in disabling leakage. Much effort is devoted by serious players to restoring wood combs and sealing leaks. Some players used to soak wooden-combed harmonicas ([[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonics]], without windsavers) in water to cause a slight expansion, which they intended to make the seal between the comb, reed plates and covers more airtight. Modern wooden-combed harmonicas are less prone to swelling and contracting. Players still dip harmonicas in water for the way it affects tone and ease of bending notes.

===Reed plate===
The reed plate is a grouping of several reeds in a single housing. The reeds are usually made of brass, but steel, aluminium and plastic are occasionally used. Individual reeds are usually riveted to the reed plate, but they may also be welded or screwed in place. Reeds fixed on the inner side of the reed plate (within the comb's air chamber) respond to blowing, while those fixed on the outer side respond to suction.

Most harmonicas are constructed with the reed plates screwed or bolted to the comb or each other. A few brands still use the traditional method of nailing the reed plates to the comb. Some experimental and rare harmonicas also have had the reed plates held in place by tension, such as the WWII era all-American models. If the plates are bolted to the comb, the reed plates can be replaced individually. This is useful because the reeds eventually go out of tune through normal use, and certain notes of the scale can fail more quickly than others.

A notable exception to the traditional reed plate design is the all-plastic harmonicas designed by Finn Magnus in the 1950s, in which the reed and reed plate were molded out of a single piece of plastic. The Magnus design had the reeds, reed plates and comb made of plastic and either molded or permanently glued together.

===Cover plates===
Cover plates cover the reed plates and are usually made of metal, though wood and plastic have also been used. The choice of these is personal; because they project sound, they determine the tonal quality of the harmonica. There are two types of cover plates: traditional open designs of stamped metal or plastic, which are simply there to be held; and enclosed designs (such as the [[Hohner]] Meisterklasse and Super 64, [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]] Promaster and SCX), which offer a louder tonal quality. From these two basic types, a few modern designs have been created, such as the Hohner CBH-2016 chromatic and the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]] Overdrive diatonic, which have complex covers that allow for specific functions not usually available in the traditional design. It was not unusual in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for harmonicas to have special features on the covers, such as [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], which could be rung by pushing a button.

===Windsavers===
''Windsavers'' are one-way valves made from thin strips of plastic, knit paper, leather or Teflon glued to the reed plate. They are typically found in chromatic harmonicas, chord harmonicas and many octave-tuned harmonicas. Windsavers are used when two reeds share a cell and leakage through the nonplaying reed would be significant. For example, when a draw note is played, the valve on the blow reed-slot is sucked shut, preventing air from leaking through the inactive blow reed. An exception to this is the now-discontinued Hohner XB-40, on which valves are placed not to isolate single reeds but rather to isolate entire chambers from being active, a design that made it possible to play traditional blues bends on all reeds.

===Mouthpiece===
The mouthpiece is placed between the air chambers of the instrument and the player's mouth. This can be integral with the comb (the diatonic harmonicas; the Hohner Chrometta); part of the cover (as in Hohner's CX-12); or may be a separate unit, secured by screws, which is typical of chromatics. In many harmonicas, the mouthpiece is purely an ergonomic aid designed to make playing more comfortable. However, in the traditional slider-based chromatic harmonica, it is essential to the functioning of the instrument because it provides a groove for the slide.

===Accessories===
[[Image:Mark Wenner on amplified harmonica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|125px|[[Mark Wenner]] cups his hands around a &quot;bullet mic&quot; as he plays amplified harmonica]]

====Amplification devices====

Since the 1950s, many [[blues]] harmonica players have amplified their instrument with microphones and [[instrument amplifier|tube amplifiers]]. One of the early innovators of this approach was Marion &quot;[[Little Walter]]&quot; Jacobs, who played the harmonica near a &quot;Bullet&quot; [[microphone]] marketed for use by radio [[Taxicab#Dispatching|taxi dispatchers]]. This gave his harmonica tone  a &quot;punchy&quot; midrange sound that could be heard above an electric guitar. As well, tube amplifiers produce a natural growling [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] when cranked at higher volumes, which adds body, fullness and &quot;grit&quot; to the sound. Little Walter also cupped his hands around the instrument, tightening the air around the harp, giving it a powerful, distorted sound, somewhat reminiscent of a [[saxophone]], hence the term &quot;Mississippi saxophone&quot;. Some harmonica players in folk use a regular vocal mic, such as a [[Shure SM 58]] for their harmonica, which gives a clean, natural sound.

As technology in amplification has progressed, harmonica players have introduced other [[effects unit]]s to their rigs as well, such as [[spring reverb|reverb]], [[tremolo]], [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[octave]], additional [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] pedals, and [[chorus effect]]. [[John Popper]] of [[Blues Traveler]] uses a customized microphone that encapsulates several of these effects into one handheld unit, as opposed to several units in sequence. Many harmonica players still prefer tube amplifiers to [[solid-state amplifier|solid-state]], owing to the perceived difference in tone generated by the [[vacuum tubes]]. Players perceive tubes as having a &quot;warmer&quot; tone and a more &quot;natural&quot; overdrive sound. Many amplifiers designed for [[electric guitar]] are also used by harmonica players, such as the [[Gibson Kalamazoo Electric Guitar#Kalamazoo Amplifiers|Kalamazoo Model Two]], [[Fender Bassman]], and the [[Danelectro Commando]]. Some expensive, handmade [[boutique amplifiers]], however, are built from the ground up with characteristics that are optimal for amplified harmonica.

====Rack or holder====
[[Image:Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.jpg |thumb|200px|[[Joan Baez]] and [[Bob Dylan]], 1963.  Dylan is wearing a harmonica holder.]]

Harmonica players who play the instrument while performing on another instrument with their hands (e.g., an acoustic guitar) often use an accessory called a ''neck rack'' or ''harmonica holder'' to position the instrument in front of their mouth. A harmonica holder clamps the harmonica between two metal brackets, which are attached to a curved loop of metal that rests on the shoulders. The original harmonica racks were made from wire or coat hangers.  Models of harmonica racks vary widely by quality and ease of use, and it quite often takes experimenting with more than one model of harmonica rack to find one that feels suitable for each individual player. This device is used by folk musicians, [[one-man band]]s and singer-songwriters such as &lt;!-- THESE ARE SELECTIVE EXAMPLES, NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. GET CONSENSUS TO ADD MORE. --&gt;[[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Harmon]], [[Neil Young]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and blues singers [[Jimmy Reed]] and [[John Hammond Jr.]]&lt;!-- THESE ARE SELECTIVE EXAMPLES, NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. GET CONSENSUS TO ADD MORE. --&gt; The HarpArm is a magnetic harmonica holder that attaches to standard straight or boom microphone stands.

==Harmonica types==
===Chromatic harmonica===
{{Main|chromatic harmonica}}
[[Image:Chromonica.jpg|thumb|left|Hohner Super Chromonica, a typical 12-hole chromatic]]
The chromatic harmonica uses a button-activated sliding bar to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate, though one design—the &quot;Machino-Tone&quot;—controlled airflow by means of a lever-operated flap on the rear of the instrument. Also, a &quot;hands-free&quot; modification to the Hohner 270 (12-hole) lets the player shift the tones by moving the mouthpiece up and down with the lips, leaving the hands free to play another instrument. While the [[Richter tuning|Richter-tuned]] 10-hole chromatic is intended to play in only one key, the 12-, 14-, and 16-hole models (which are tuned to equal temperament) allow the musician to play in any key desired with only one harmonica. This harp can be used for any style, including Celtic, classical, jazz, or blues (commonly in third position).

===Diatonic harmonicas===
Strictly speaking, diatonic denotes any harmonica designed to play in a single key—though the standard [[Richter-tuned harmonica]] diatonic can play other keys by forcing its reeds to play tones that are not part of its basic scale. Depending on the country, &quot;diatonic harmonica&quot; may mean either the tremolo harmonica (in East Asia) or blues harp (In Europe and North America). Other diatonic harmonicas include octave harmonicas.

Here is the note layout for a standard diatonic in the key of G major:

:{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 1 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 2 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 3 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 4 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 5 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 6 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 7 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 8 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 9 !! style=&quot;width: 20px;&quot; | 10

| G || B || D || G || B || D || G || B || D || G
|-
! draw
| A || C || F{{music|#}} || A || C || E || F{{music|#}} || A || C || E
|}

Each hole is the same [[interval (music)|interval]] (here, a [[perfect fifth]]) from its key of C counterpart; on the diatonic scale, a  G is a perfect fifth from C. The interval between keys can be used to find the note layout of any standard diatonic.

===Tremolo-tuned harmonica===
{{Main|tremolo harmonica}}
[[Image:Suzuki Humming.png|right|thumb|225px|A tremolo harmonica]]
The distinguishing feature of the tremolo-tuned harmonica is that it has two reeds per note, with one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. This provides a unique wavering or warbling sound created by the two reeds being slightly out of tune with each other and the difference in their subsequent waveforms interacting with each other (its [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]]). The Asian version, which can produce all 12 semitones, is used often in East Asian rock and pop music.

===Orchestral harmonicas===
Orchestral harmonicas are primarily designed for use in ensemble playing.

====Orchestral melody harmonica====
There are eight kinds of orchestral melody harmonica; the most common are the '''horn''' harmonicas often found in East Asia. These consist of a single large comb with blow-only reed-plates on the top and bottom. Each reed sits inside a single cell in the comb. One version mimics the layout of a piano or mallet instrument, with the natural notes of a C diatonic scale in the lower reed plate and the sharps and flats in the upper reed plate in groups of two and three holes with gaps in between like the black keys of a piano. Another version has one &quot;sharp&quot; reed directly above its &quot;natural&quot; on the lower plate, with the same number of reeds on both plates (therefore including E{{music|#}} and B{{music|#}}).

Horn harmonicas are available in several pitch ranges, with the lowest pitched starting two octaves below middle C and the highest beginning on middle C itself; they usually cover a two- or three-octave range. They are chromatic instruments and are usually played in an East Asian harmonica orchestra instead of the &quot;[[push-button]]&quot; chromatic harmonica that is more common in the European and American tradition. Their reeds are often larger, and the enclosing &quot;horn&quot; gives them a different timbre, so that they often function in place of a brass section. In the past, they were referred to as horn harmonicas.

The other type of orchestral melodic harmonica is the polyphonia, (though some are marked &quot;chromatica&quot;). These have all twelve chromatic notes laid out on the same row. In most cases, they have both blow and draw of the same tone, though the No. 7 is blow only, and the No. 261, also blow only, has two reeds per hole, tuned an octave apart (all these designations refer to products of M. Hohner).

====Chord harmonica====
The chord harmonica has up to 48 chords: [[Major chord|major]], [[Seventh chord|seventh]], [[Minor chord|minor]], [[Augmented chord|augmented]] and [[diminished triad|diminished]] for ensemble playing. It is laid out in four-note clusters, each sounding a different chord on inhaling or exhaling. Typically each hole has two reeds for each note, tuned to one octave of each other. However, less expensive models often have only one reed per note. Quite a few orchestra harmonicas are also designed to serve as both bass and chord harmonica, with bass notes next to chord groupings. There are also other chord harmonicas, such as the Chordomonica (which operates similar to a chromatic harmonica), and the junior chord harmonicas (which typically provide six chords).

The Suzuki SSCH-56 Compact Chord harmonica is a 48-chord harmonica built in a 14-hole chromatic harmonica enclosure. The first three holes play a major chord on blow and draw, with and without the slide. Holes 2, 3, and 4 play a diminished chord; holes 3, 4, and 5 play a minor chord; and holes 4, 5, and 6 play an augmented, for a total of sixteen chords. This pattern is repeated starting on hole 5, a whole step higher; and again starting on hole 9, for a total of 48 chords.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suzukimusic.com/harmonicas/CHORD56/&lt;/ref&gt;

===ChengGong harmonica===
The ChengGong harmonica&lt;ref&gt;(a pun on the inventor's surname and {{lang|zh|成功}}, or &quot;success,&quot; pronounced &quot;chenggong&quot; in Mandarin Chinese) harmonica, invented by Cheng Xuexue {{lang|zh|程雪學}} of China.&lt;/ref&gt; has a main body, and a sliding mouthpiece. The body is a 24-hole diatonic harmonica that ranges from B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (covering 3 octaves). Its 11-hole mouthpiece can slide along the front of the harmonica, which gives numerous chord choices and voicings (seven triads, three 6th chords, seven 7th chords, and seven 9th chords, for a total of 24 chords). As well, it is capable of playing single-note melodies and double stops over a range of three diatonic octaves. Unlike conventional harmonicas, blowing and drawing produce the same notes because its tuning is closer to the note layout of a typical Asian tremolo harmonica or the Polyphonias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = P | last = Missin | title = ChengGong harmonica | url = http://www.patmissin.com/gallery/gallery03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch pipe===
The [[pitch pipe]] is a simple specialty harmonica that provides a reference pitch to singers and other instruments. The only difference between some early pitch-pipes and harmonicas is the name of the instrument, which reflected the maker's target audience. Chromatic pitch pipes, which are used by singers and choirs, give a full chromatic (12-note) octave. Pitch pipes are also sold for string players, such as violinists and guitarists; these pitch pipes usually provide the notes corresponding to the open strings.

===Glass diatonic harmonica===
&lt;!--[[Glass diatonic harmonica]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
{{Distinguish|Glass harmonica}}

The first glass diatonic harmonica (diatonic harmonica made of glass) was created by Geoff Stengel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eugeneglassmenagerie.com/|title=Eugene Glass Menagerie|accessdate=29 July 2013}}{{Primary-source-inline|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009. It was constructed out of [[borosilicate glass]], the reeds were interchangeable and the screws were brass. All of the color was hand mixed using different [[oxide]]s and borosilicate glass. Stengel has been specializing in making his own color and tubing for many years.

===Electric harmonica===
The electric harmonica has been said to have been invented by Richard Smith, of Harmonix Harmonicas, as he is the inventor and holder of worldwide [[patent]]s for placing a [[microphone]] inside the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Missin|first1=Pat|title=Harmonix Modular Harmonica System|url=http://www.harmsol.co.uk/press.asp?id=158|website=Harmonix|publisher=Harmonica World|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Main|Harmonica techniques}}

'''Vibrato''' is a technique commonly used while playing the harmonica and many other instruments, to give the note a 'shaking' sound. This technique can be accomplished in a number of ways. The most common way is to change how the harmonica is held. For example, the vibrato effect can be achieved by opening and closing the hands around the harmonica very rapidly. The vibrato might also be achieved via rapid glottal (vocal fold) opening and closing, especially on draws (inhalation) simultaneous to bending, or without bending. This obviates the need for cupping and waving the hands around the instrument during play. An effect similar to vibrato is that of the 'trill' (or 'roll', or 'warble, or 'shake'); this technique has the player move their lips between two holes very quickly, either by shaking the head in a rapid motion or moving the harmonica from side to side within the embouchure. This gives a quick pitch-alternating technique that is slightly more than vibrato and achieves the same aural effect on sustained notes, albeit by using two different tones instead of varying the amplitude of one.

In addition to the 19 notes readily available on the diatonic harmonica, players can play other notes by adjusting their [[embouchure]] and forcing the reed to resonate at a different pitch. This technique is called '''bending''', a term possibly borrowed from guitarists, who literally bend a string to subtly change the pitch. Bending also creates the glissandos characteristic of much blues harp and country harmonica playing. Bends are essential for most blues and rock harmonica due to the soulful sounds the instrument can bring out. The &quot;wail&quot; of the blues harp typically requires bending. In the 1970s, [[Howard Levy]] developed the '''over bending''' technique (also known as &quot;overblowing&quot; and &quot;overdrawing&quot;.) '''Over Bending''', combined with bending, allowed players to play the entire chromatic scale.

In addition to playing the diatonic harmonica in its original key, it is also possible to play it in other keys by playing in other &quot;positions&quot; using different keynotes. Using just the basic notes on the instrument would mean playing in a specific mode for each position. Harmonica players (especially blues players) have developed terminology around different &quot;positions,&quot; which can be confusing to other musicians, for example the slang terminology for the most common positions (1st being 'straight', 2nd being 'cross', 3rd being 'slant', etc.).

Another technique, seldom used to its full potential, is altering the size of the mouth cavity to emphasize certain natural [[overtones]]. When this technique is employed while playing chords, care must be taken in overtone selection as the overtones stemming from the non-root pitch can cause extreme dissonance.

Harmonica players who amplify their instrument with microphones and [[instrument amplifier|tube amplifiers]], such as blues harp players, also have a range of techniques that exploit properties of the microphone and the amplifier, such as changing the way the hands are cupped around the instrument and the microphone or rhythmically breathing or chanting into the microphone while playing. Blues and folk players refer to the instrument with a range of less common names, including ''hand reed,'' ''Mississippi saxophone,'' ''licking stick,'' ''pocket sax,'' ''toe pickle,'' ''tin sandwich,'' ''ten-holed tin-can tongue twister,'' ''blues burger,'' ''harpoon,'' ''moothie,'' and ''French harp''.

'''Harmonica coupling or coupled harmonica'''

This is a new technique of harmonica playing developed by William Price &lt;ref&gt;http://harmonicareinvented.com/&lt;/ref&gt; in which two ten-hole diatonic harmonicas tuned a full step apart are coupled together by simply bolting one on top of the other using the bolt holes the manufacturer uses to attach the covers. For example, a Bb harmonica can be coupled above a C harmonica. The advantage of this is that it fills out the lower octave. It also provides interesting chord and scale possibilities otherwise not available on a standard diatonic harmonica.

Some songs are difficult to play because they require accurate bending technique. Coupling provides the missing scale notes without the need for bending notes. But it still allows the player to bend notes to enhance the musicality of the song.

==History==
The harmonica was developed in Europe in the early part of the 19th century. Free-reed instruments like the Chinese [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] were fairly common in Asia since ancient times. They became relatively well known in Europe after being introduced by the French Jesuit [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot]] (1718-1793), who lived in [[Qianlong Emperor|Qing-era]] China.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Encyclopedia of the Harmonica&quot;&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Indes_galantes_Les%28The_Gallant_Indies%29.htm &quot;Indes galantes, Les (The Gallant Indies,&quot;] Naxos.com website (accessed 1 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1820, free-reed designs began being created in Europe. [[Christian Buschmann|Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]] is often cited as the inventor of the harmonica in 1821, but other inventors developed similar instruments at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Conny Restle]]: In aller Munde, S. 43, Staatl. Institut für Musikforschung, Berlin 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mouth-blown free-reed instruments appeared in the United States, South America, the United Kingdom and Europe at roughly the same time. These instruments were made for playing classical music.

===Early instruments===
The harmonica first appeared in Vienna, where harmonicas with chambers were sold before 1824 (see also [[Anton Reinlein]] and [[Anton Haeckl]]). Richter tuning, invented by Joseph Richter (who also is credited with inventing the blow and draw mechanism), was created in 1826 and was eventually adopted nearly universally. In Germany, violin manufacturer Mr. Meisel from Klingenthal bought a harmonica with chambers (Kanzellen) at the Exhibition in Braunschweig in 1824. He and the ironworker Langhammer in the 3-mile-away Graslitz copied the instruments; by 1827 they had produced hundreds of harmonicas. Many others followed in Germany and also nearby in what would later become Czechoslovakia. In 1829, Johann Wilhelm Rudolph Glier also began making harmonicas.

In 1830, Christian Messner, a cloth maker and weaver from [[Trossingen]], copied a harmonica his neighbour had brought from Vienna. He had such success that eventually his brother and some relatives also started to make harmonicas. From 1840 onwards, his nephew Christian Weiss was also involved in the business. By 1855, there were at least three harmonica-making businesses: [[C. A. Seydel Söhne]], [[Christian Messner]] &amp; Co., and Württ. Harmonikafabrik Ch. Weiss. (Currently, only [[C. A. Seydel Söhne|C.A. Seydel]] is still in business.) Owing to competition between the harmonica factories in Trossingen and Klingenthal, machines were invented to punch the covers for the reeds.

In 1857, Matthias Hohner, a clockmaker from Trossingen, started producing harmonicas. Eventually he became the first to mass-produce them. He used a mass-produced wooden comb that he had made by machine-cutting firms. By 1868, he began supplying the United States. By the 1920s, the diatonic harmonica had largely reached its modern form. Other types followed soon thereafter, including the various tremolo and [[octave]] harmonicas.

By the late 19th century, harmonica production was a big business, having evolved into mass production. New designs were still developed in the 20th century, including the [[chromatic harmonica]], first made by Hohner in 1924, the bass harmonica, and the chord harmonica. In the 21st century, radical new designs have been developed and are still being introduced into the market, such as the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]] Overdrive, Hohner XB-40, and the ill-fated Harrison B-Radical.

Diatonic harmonicas were designed primarily for playing German and other European [[folk music]] and have succeeded well in those styles. Over time, the basic design and tuning proved adaptable to other types of music such as the [[blues]], [[country music|country]], old-time and more. The harmonica was a success almost from the very start of production, and while the center of the harmonica business has shifted from Germany, the output of the various harmonica manufacturers is still very high. Major companies are now found in Germany ([[:de:C. A. Seydel Söhne|Seydel]], Bushman, [[Hohner]] – the dominant manufacturer in the world), Japan ([[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]], [[Tombo Musical Instrument Company|Tombo]] – the manufacturer of the popular [[Lee Oskar]] harmonica, and [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] also made harmonicas until the 1970s), China (Huang, Johnson, Leo Shi, [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]], Hohner, Swan, AXL), and [[Brazil]] (Hering, Bends). The United States had two significant harmonica manufacturers, and both were based in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union, New Jersey]]. One was [[Magnus Harmonica Corporation]], whose founder Finn Magnus is credited with the development of plastic harmonica reeds. The other was Wm. Kratt Company, which, founded by German-American William Jacob &quot;Bill&quot; Kratt Sr., originally made [[pitch pipe]]s and later, in 1952, secured a patent for combs made of plastic. Both companies ceased harmonica production. The only recent American contender in the harmonica market was Harrison Harmonicas, which folded in July 2011. It was announced soon thereafter that the rights to the Harrison design had been sold to another company to finish production of orders already placed. In October 2012, it was revealed that a [[Beloit, Wisconsin]], investment corporation, R&amp;R Opportunities, had bought the assets of Harrison Harmonicas and that a feasibility study was under way to assess the possibilities of continued production of the Harrison B-Radical harmonica. Recently, responding to increasingly demanding performance techniques, the market for high-quality instruments has grown.

===Europe and North America===
Some time before Hohner began manufacturing harmonicas in 1857, he shipped some to relatives who had emigrated to the United States. Its music rapidly became popular, and the country became an enormous market for Hohner's goods. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] carried a harmonica in his pocket,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hohnerusa.com/ahistory.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127182041/http://www.hohnerusa.com/ahistory.htm |date=January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmonicas provided solace to soldiers on both the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sides of the [[American Civil War]]. Frontiersmen [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Billy the Kid]] played the instrument, and it became a fixture of the American musical landscape.

Harmonicas were heard on a handful of recordings in the early 1900s, generally labeled as a &quot;mouth organ&quot;. The first jazz or traditional music recordings of harmonicas were made in the U.S. in the mid-1920s. Recordings known at the time as &quot;race records&quot;, intended for the black market of the southern states, included solo recordings by [[DeFord Bailey]] and duo recordings with a guitarist ([[Hammie Nixon]], [[Big Walter Horton|Walter Horton]], or [[Sonny Terry]]). [[Hillbilly]] styles were also recorded, intended for white audiences, by [[Frank Hutchison]], [[Gwen Foster]] and several other musicians. There are also recordings featuring the harmonica in [[jug band]]s, of which the [[Memphis Jug Band]] is the most famous. But the harmonica still represented a toy instrument in those years and was associated with the poor. It is also during those years that musicians started experimenting with new techniques such as tongue-blocking, hand effects and the most important innovation of all, the second position, or cross-harp.

A significant contributor to the expanding popularity of the harmonica was a New York-based radio program called the ''Hohner Harmony Hour'', which taught listeners how to play. Listeners could play along with the program to increase their proficiency. The radio program gained wide popularity after the unavailing of the 1925 White House Christmas tree, which was adorned with fifty harmonicas.

The harmonica's versatility brought it to the attention of classical musicians during the 1930s. American [[Larry Adler]] was one of the first harmonica players to perform major works written for the instrument by the composers [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arthur Benjamin]].

Harmonicas were in short supply in the United States during [[World War II]]. Wood and metal materials for harmonicas were in short supply because of military demand. Furthermore, the primary harmonica manufacturers were based in Germany and Japan, the enemies of the United States and the Allied forces in the war. During this time, Finn Haakon Magnus, a Danish-American factory worker and entrepreneur, developed and perfected the molded plastic harmonica. The plastic harmonica used molded plastic combs and far fewer pieces than traditional metal or wood harmonicas, which made the harmonica more economical to mass-produce and more sanitary. Though the plastic reeds in these harmonicas produced a less distinctive (and, to many ears, inferior) sound than their metallic counterparts, [[Magnus Harmonica Corporation|Magnus harmonicas]] and several imitators soon became commonplace, particularly among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA244&amp;lpg=RA1-PA244&amp;dq=Finn+Haakon+Magnus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kYehT3zxkD&amp;sig=FBKN1OxaVI_PhJEjOZGp0qbPJuc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ELIXTIeKFsG88ga_5JytCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Finn%20Haakon%20Magnus&amp;f=false |title=Popular Science – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent for the plastic comb, however, was awarded to William Kratt of Wm. Kratt Company in 1952. During World War II, the [[United States Department of Defense|War Department]] allotted a rationed supply of brass to Kratt's factory so they could continue to produce harmonicas that the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] distributed to American troops overseas to boost morale.

===East Asia===
In 1898, the harmonica was brought to Japan, where the Tremolo harmonica was the most popular instrument. After about 30 years, the Japanese developed scale tuning and semitone harmonicas that could play Japanese folk songs.

==== Japanese style tremolo harmonica tuning ====
In Europe and the United States, tremolo harmonica uses the Richter tuning, developed in Germany. In 1913, Shōgo Kawaguchi ({{lang|ja|川口章吾}}), known in Japan as the &quot;Father of the harmonica&quot;, devised an alternate tuning, which is more suited to playing Japanese folk tunes. This tuning is also suited to local music throughout East Asia, and harmonicas using the tuning became popular in the region.

==== Minor key harmonica tuning ====
Initial diatonic harmonica tunings were major key only. In 1931, Hiderō Satō ({{lang|ja|佐藤秀廊}}) announced the development of a minor key harmonica. There are two types of minor key tunings, &quot;natural minor&quot; suitable for folk and contemporary music, and Latin American music, and the &quot;harmonic minor&quot; suitable for Japanese folk music.

====The harmonica in Hong Kong — China====
The harmonica started to gain popularity in Hong Kong in the 1930s.  Individual tremolo harmonica players from China moved to Hong Kong and established numerous harmonica organizations such as The Chinese Y.M.C.A. Harmonica Orchestra, the China Harmonica Society,&lt;ref&gt;({{lang|zh-Hant|中國口琴社}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the Heart String Harmonica Society. During the 1950s, chromatic harmonica became popular in Hong Kong, and players such as [[Larry Adler]] and [[John Sebastian (classical harmonica player)|John Sebastian Sr.]] were invited to perform.

Local players such as Lau Mok ({{lang|zh-Hant|劉牧}}) and Fung On ({{lang|zh-Hant|馮安}}) promoted the chromatic harmonica. The chromatic harmonica gradually became the main instrument used by the Chinese Y.M.C.A. Harmonica Orchestra. The Chinese [[YMCA]] Harmonica Orchestra started in the 1960s, with 100 members, most of whom played harmonicas.&lt;ref&gt;The violin and viola were replaced by 12-hole and 16-hole chromonicas; cello by chord harmonica, contra bass and octave bass; double bass by octave bass; flute by pipe soprano; clarinet by pipe alto; trumpet by horn soprano; trombone by horn alto; oboe by melodica soprano; English horn by melodica alto; French horn by melodica professional.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-harmonica instruments were also used, such as double bass, accordion, piano, and percussion such as timpani and xylophone.

In the 1970s, the Haletone Harmonica Orchestra ({{lang|zh-Hant|曉彤口琴隊}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haletone.com/introeng.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221174146/http://www.haletone.com/introeng.html |date=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up at Wong Tai Sin Community Centre. Fung On and others continued to teach harmonica and also set up harmonica orchestras. In the 1980s, numbers of harmonica students steadily decreased. In the 1990s, harmonica players from Hong Kong began to participate in international harmonica competitions, including the [[World Harmonica Festival]] in Germany and the [[Asia Pacific Harmonica Festival]]. In the 2000s, the Hong Kong Harmonica Association (H.K.H.A.) ({{lanz|zh-Hant|香港口琴協會}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkharmonica.org/index.php |title=Hong Kong Harmonica Association |publisher=Hkharmonica.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established.

The history of the harmonica in Taiwan began around 1945. By the 1980s, though, as living standards improved, many instruments once beyond the budgets of most Taiwanese started to become more accessible and popular in preference to the harmonica.

==Medical use==
Playing the harmonica requires inhaling and exhaling strongly against resistance. This action helps develop a strong [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and deep breathing using the entire [[lung volume]]. [[human lung|Pulmonary]] specialists have noted that playing the harmonica resembles the kind of exercise used to [[Physical therapy#Cardiopulmonary physiotherapy|rehabilitate]] [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] patients such as using a [[PFLEX]] inspiratory muscle trainer or the inspiratory [[spirometer]]. Learning to play a musical instrument also offers motivation in addition to the exercise component. Many pulmonary rehabilitation programs {{specify|date=June 2012}} therefore have begun to incorporate the harmonica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harmonica For Fun &amp; Health Classes | publisher = Harmonica Masterclass | url = http://www.harmonicamasterclass.com/pulm.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060630001951/http://harmonicamasterclass.com/pulm.htm | archivedate = 2006-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = When breathing needs a tune-up, harmonica class hits all the right notes | date = September 28, 2005 | publisher = University of Michigan | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/hmharmonica.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060524095509/http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/hmharmonica.htm | archivedate = May 24, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Pulmonologists Treat Breath Shortness with Harmonica Classes | date = January 1, 2006 | publisher = American Institute of Physics | url = http://www.aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15114.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060617150522/http://aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15114.html | archivedate = June 17, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Using the Harmonica in Physical Therapy.

==Competitions==
The World Harmonica Festival is held in the autumn every four years in [[Trossingen]], Germany, home of the Hohner harmonica company. The last World Harmonica Festival was in 2009, and a harmonica workshop is held every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmonicasessions.com/feb06/festival.html A report of the 2005 World Harmonica Festival by David Barrett] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522041621/http://www.harmonicasessions.com/feb06/festival.html |date=2007-05-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asia Pacific Harmonica Festival]] is held regularly; in 2008 it was hosted by China.

In Hong Kong, Schools Music Festival is held every year for school students to compete in different music classes. Harmonica classes include band for primary and secondary schools, ensemble for secondary school, duet for secondary school, solo (junior, intermediate, and senior), and concert work (open).

Every August there is a harmonica contest in Idaho. The contest has been running since 1989. The contest is held in Yellow Pine about {{convert|150|miles}} outside of Boise, Idaho and is called the Yellow Pine Harmonica Contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmonicacontest.com Yellow Pine Harmonica Contest website].&lt;/ref&gt;

Also held in August each year is the Bean Blossom Harmonica Contest.  Beginning in 1999 as an event at the Bean Blossom Blues Fest, the contest has 3 divisions:  Youth (ages 1–15), Adult (16 and above), and Group (2 or more players of any age). In addition to other attractive prizes awarded to the top 3 winners in each division, the first-place winner of the Adult Division is invited to perform on the main stage of the Bean Blossom Blues Fest later that evening in front of a crowd of several thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beanblossomblues.com/contest.html Bean Blossom Harmonica Contest website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related instruments==
The [[concertina]], diatonic and chromatic [[accordions]] and the [[melodica]] are all free-reed instruments that developed alongside the harmonica. Indeed, the similarities between harmonicas and so-called &quot;diatonic&quot; [[accordions]] or melodeons is such that in German the name for the former is &quot;Mundharmonika&quot; and the latter &quot;Handharmonika,&quot; which translate as &quot;mouth harmonica&quot; and &quot;hand harmonica.&quot; In Scandinavian languages, an accordion is simply called &quot;harmonika,&quot; whereas a harmonica is a &quot;mundharmonika&quot; (mouth harmonica). The names for the two instruments in the Slavic languages are also either similar or identical. The harmonica shares similarities to all other free-reed instruments by virtue of the method of sound production.

The [[glass harmonica]] has the word &quot;harmonica&quot; in its name, but it is not related to free-reed instruments. The glass harmonica is a musical instrument formed from a nested set of graduated glass cups mounted sideways on an axle. Each of the glass cups is tuned to a different note, and they are arranged in a scalar order. It is played by touching the rotating cups with wetted fingers, causing them to vibrate and produce a sustained &quot;singing&quot; tone.

==Notation==

===Tablature===
[[Tabulature|Tablature]] notation (often abbreviated as &quot;tab&quot;) is a method of writing melodies by indicating where the notes are played on the instrument, rather than by indicating the pitches with circles and note heads printed on a staff, as with standard notation. One of the advantages of tab is that it can be easier for performers without formal training to learn, because the notation directly indicates where to play the note.

While tab is most often associated with fretted stringed instruments such as the guitar, tab is also used with other instruments such as the organ and harmonica.

There are many harmonica tab systems in use. A simple tab system appears as follows:

Diatonic Harmonica tab:

  2  = blow the 2 hole &lt; Also: +2 &gt;
 -2  = draw the 2 hole
 -2' = draw the 2 hole with a half bend &lt; Also -2b &gt;
 -2&quot; = draw the 2 hole with a full bend &lt; Also -2bb&gt;

Chords are shown by grouping notes with parentheses

(2 3) = blow the 2 hole and the 3 hole at the same time

Chromatic Harmonica tab:

   2 = blow the 2 hole
  -2 = draw the 2 hole
  &lt;2 = blow the 2 hole with the button in
 &lt;-2 = draw the 2 hole with the button in

Text Tab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harmonicalessons.com/tabs.html |title=Harmonica Tabs / Blues Harp Songs and Harmonica Tab, Bluesharp Music, Blues Harp Notes, Internet Tablatur/ Free &amp; Members Tabs Areas |publisher=Harmonicalessons.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another common type of harmonica tablature. It indicates when a player should &quot;blow&quot; or &quot;draw&quot; on a note by appending a letter suffix (B for blow or D for draw) to the appropriate harmonica hole number. Text Tab is used by harmonica instructors such as [[Dave Gage]] and [[Jon Gindick]]. It can be found on their websites and books and web forums.

Harmonica tab is usually aligned with lyrics to show the tune and the timing, and usually states the key of the harmonica required for the song.

Complete example of harmonica tab:
&lt;pre&gt;
Cockles And Mussels (Molly Malone):
6  7  7     7    7 8   7     -8    -8  -8 -8  -9
In Dublin's fair city, where girls are so pretty,
-8 9    9   9  9     9  7     -8 8  7 -8
I first set my sight on sweet Molly Malone.
6   7   7 7   7  8    7   -8    -8     -8 -9
She was a fishmonger, and she'd stroll along,
8   8    9  8    7   9  8     7 -8   8 -8   7
Singing &quot;Cockles And Mussels, Alive, Alive, Oh.&quot;
6 7   7 7   -8 8  7 -8  -8 -8 -8 8
Alive alive oh-oh Alive alive oh-oh
7   7   9   8   7   9  8    7 -8  8 -8  7
Singing Cockles and Mussels alive alive oh
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Regular notation===
A number (sometimes inside a circle) appears below each note in otherwise conventional [[sheet music]], and indicates which number hole to play. An up or down arrow beneath the number indicates whether to blow or draw. Up means blow and down means draw. A curved arrow indicates bend notes—slightly to the left for a half step flat, and longer to the left to indicate a whole step flat. Right-pointing arrows indicate a sharp bend.

'''Hops''' are the [[flower]]s (also called seed cones or [[strobilus|strobiles]]) of the hop plant ''[[Humulus lupulus]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umn.edu/botanical/plant.php |title=University of Minnesota Libraries: The Transfer of Knowledge. Hops-'&amp;#39;Humulus lupulus'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lib.umn.edu |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in [[beer]], to which they impart bitter, zesty, or citric flavours;&lt;ref name=&quot;schon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing (Wiley Online Library)|volume=117|issue=3|date=16 May 2012|authors=Schönberger C, Kostelecky T|title=125th Anniversary Review: The Role of Hops in Brewing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.2011.tb00471.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they are also used for various purposes in other beverages and [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]]. The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, [[herbaceous]] [[Perennial plant|perennial]], usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the [[West Country]] and U.S.) when grown commercially. Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types being used for particular styles of beer.

The first documented use of hops in beer is from the 9th century{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, though [[Hildegard of Bingen]], 300 years later, is often cited as the earliest documented source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Beer and Brewing |year=2003  |last=Hornsey |first=Ian S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqnvNsgas20C&amp;pg=PA305 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |page=305 |isbn=9780854046300
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this period, brewers used [[gruit]], composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers, including [[dandelion]], [[Burdock|burdock root]], [[Calendula|marigold]], [[Common horehound|horehound]] (the old German name for horehound, ''Berghopfen'', means &quot;mountain hops&quot;), [[ground ivy]], and [[Calluna|heather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jongriffin.com/articles/understanding-beer/ |title=Understanding Beer - A Broad Overview of Brewing, Tasting and Analyzing Beer - October 12th, 2006, Beer &amp; Brewing, The Brewing Process |publisher=Jongriffin.com |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315195032/http://jongriffin.com/articles/understanding-beer/ |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early documents include mention of a hop garden in the will of [[Charlemagne]]'s father, [[Pepin III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Michael Jackson  | authorlink = Michael Jackson (writer)  | title = The New World World Guide to Beer | publisher = Running Press |year= 1988  | page = 18  | isbn = 0-89471-884-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to adding flavor to beer, hops are also used in brewing for their [[Antibiotics|antibacterial]] effect over less desirable [[microorganisms]] and for many purported benefits, including balancing the sweetness of the [[malt]] with [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]], contributing a variety of desirable flavors and aromas.&lt;ref name=schon/&gt; Historically, traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less prone to spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F.

==History==
The first documented hop cultivation was in 736, in the [[Hallertau]] region of present-day Germany{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was 1079.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author =H.S. Corran  | title = History of Brewing | publisher =David and Charles PLC |date=23 Jan 1975  | page =303 | url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=17784589708&amp;searchurl=isbn%3D0715367358%26tn%3DA%2520History%2520of%2520Brewing%26an%3Dcorran | isbn = 0715367358}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a will of [[Pepin the Short]], the father of [[Charlemagne]], hop gardens were left to the Cloister of Saint-Denis in 768. Not until the 13th century did hops begin to start threatening the use of [[gruit]] for flavoring. Gruit was used when taxes were levied by the nobility on hops. Whichever was taxed made the brewer then quickly switch to the other. In Britain, hopped beer was first imported from Holland around 1400, yet hops were condemned as late as 1519 as a &quot;wicked and pernicious weed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Richard W. Unger  | title = Beer in the Middle Ages and Renaissance | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year= 2004 | page = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1471, [[Norwich]], England, banned use of the plant in the brewing of [[ale]] (&quot;beer&quot; was the name for fermented malt liquors bittered with hops; only in recent times are the words often used as synonyms).

In Germany, using hops was also a religious and political choice in the early 16th century. There was no tax on hops to be paid on the Catholic church, unlike on gruit, for which the Protestant preferred hopped beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.academia.edu/28640210/The_Reformation_had_some_help_from_hops | title = The Reformation had some help from hops | author = Mika Rissanen | access-date = 2016-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hops used in England were imported from France, Holland and Germany with [[import duty]] paid for those; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England ([[Kent]]) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] farmers. Therefore, in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words (see [[oast house]]). Hops were then grown as far north as [[Aberdeen]], near breweries for infrastructure convenience.

According to [[Thomas Tusser]]'s 1557 ''Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The hop for his profit I thus do exalt,&lt;br/&gt;It strengtheneth drink and it flavoureth malt;&lt;br/&gt;And being well-brewed long kept it will last,&lt;br/&gt;And drawing abide, if ye draw not too fast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|work=The [[Penny Magazine]]|title=Antiquity of Beer|first=Charles|last=Knight|author-link=Charles Knight (publisher)|url=https://archive.org/stream/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge1832#page/n15/mode/2up|year=1832|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England there were many complaints over the quality of imported hops, the sacks of which were often contaminated by stalks, sand or straw to increase their weight. As a result, in 1603, King [[James VI and I|James I]] approved an Act of Parliament banning the practice by which &quot;the Subjects of this Realm have been of late years abused &amp;c. to the Value of £20,000 yearly, besides the Danger of their Healths&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Anderson (economist)|title=An Historical and Chronological Deduction of the Origin of Commerce|year=1764|volume=1|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalchrono01ande|page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hop cultivation was begun in the present-day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before [[Prohibition in the United States|national alcohol prohibition]], cultivation was mainly centered around New York, California, Oregon, and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Problems with [[powdery mildew]] and [[downy mildew]] devastated New York's production by the 1920s, and California only produces hops on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Paul D.|title=HOPS IN BEER|url=http://www.usahops.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=hop_info&amp;pageID=16|website=USA Hops|publisher=Hop Growers of America|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hop bar]]s were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1858 |title=Annual Report of the Commissioner of Patents, Part 2; Part 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bkdUGl7oC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=hop+bar+digging+bar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=myDyRmGzIy&amp;sig=f6ghoQW08ex5UDgt3aMkmtPsykU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMp4_ArpjWAhXB4yYKHc6pAHwQ6AEIsgEwFg#v=onepage&amp;q=hop%20bar%20digging%20bar&amp;f=false |publisher=US Patent office|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World production==
Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates, with much of the world's production occurring near the [[48th parallel north]].  Hop plants prefer the same soils as [[potato]]es and the leading potato-growing states in the United States are also major hops-producing areas;&lt;ref name=&quot;peicanada.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.peicanada.com/island_farmer/news/article_647cda78-280a-5600-8676-20673eb7ba1f.html Peicanada]&lt;/ref&gt; however, not all potato-growing areas can produce good hops naturally: soils in the [[Maritime Provinces]] of Canada, for example, lack the [[boron]] that hops prefer.&lt;ref name=&quot;peicanada.com&quot;/&gt; Historically, hops were not grown in Ireland, but were imported from England. In 1752 more than 500 [[ton]]s of English hops were imported through Dublin alone.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The London magazine, 1752&quot;, page 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Important production centers today are the [[Hallertau]] in Germany (more hop-growing area than any other country as of 2006),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmelj-giz.si/ihgc/doc/5-EC%20table%20Nov06.pdf Summary of Reports: Nürnberg, Germany, 14 November 2006], International Hop Growers' Convention: Economic Committee&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Yakima River Valley|Yakima]] ([[Washington (state)|Washington]]) and [[Willamette Valley|Willamette]] (Oregon) valleys, and western Canyon County, Idaho (including the communities of [[Parma, Idaho|Parma]], [[Wilder, Idaho|Wilder]], [[Greenleaf, Idaho|Greenleaf]], and [[Notus, Idaho|Notus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cor/humulus/huminfo.html#use |title=NCGR-Corvallis Humulus Genetic Resources |publisher=Ars-grin.gov |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal production centers in the UK are in [[Kent]] which produces Kent Goldings hops, [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Moss, [http://www.hops.co.uk/sectionone/Worcester.htm A Fancy to Worcesters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929072147/http://www.hops.co.uk/sectionone/Worcester.htm |date=29 September 2007 }}, [http://www.ars-grin.gov Agricultural research Service], U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/agriculture%20_industry/hops_history.htm |title=Herefordshire Through Time - Welcome |publisher=Smr.herefordshire.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making.

===Cultivation and harvest===
[[File:Chmelnice.jpg|thumb|left|A superstructure of overhead wires supports strings that in turn support [[Bine (botany)|bine]]s]]

Although hops are grown in most of the continental United States and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humulus lupulus L. common hop|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=HULU|work=USDA Plants database|accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment. As hops are a climbing plant, they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile. In this way, energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keegstra|first=Kenneth|date=2010-10-01|title=Plant Cell Walls|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/154/2/483|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=154|issue=2|pages=483–486|doi=10.1104/pp.110.161240|issn=1532-2548|pmc=2949028|pmid=20921169}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Male and female flowers of the hop plant usually develop on separate plants (that is, the plant is [[Androecious|dioecious]]), although fertile monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are undesirable for brewing beer, only female plants are grown in hop fields, thus preventing pollination. Female plants are propagated [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], and male plants are culled if plants are grown from seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/cultural/Humulus_lupulus_K_en.htm |title=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries. Economic Plants and their Diseases, Pests and Weeds. '&amp;#39;Humulus lupulus'&amp;#39; |publisher=Agroatlas.ru |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182625/http://www.agroatlas.ru/cultural/Humulus_lupulus_K_en.htm |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hop plants are planted in rows about {{convert|2|to|2.5|m|ft|0}} apart. Each spring, the roots send forth new [[bine (botany)|bine]]s that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis. The cones grow high on the [[bine (botany)|bine]], and in the past, these cones were picked by hand. Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention of the mechanical hops separator, patented by [[Emil Clemens Horst]] in 1909.

Harvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or [[oast house]] for drying. Hop houses are two-story buildings, of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap. Here the flowers are poured out and raked even. A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops. When dry, the hops are moved to a press, a sturdy box with a plunger. Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at right angles, the hops are poured in and compressed into bales.

Hop cones contain different oils, such as lupulin, a yellowish, waxy substance, an [[oleoresin]], that imparts flavor and aroma to beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrew|first=Sewalish|title=Hops: Anatomy and Chemistry 101|url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/sewalish_andr/Humulus%20Lupulus%20-%20Common%20Hops/Hop%20Anatomy%20and%20Chemistry%20101.html|accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lupulin contains lupulone and [[humulone]], which possess antibiotic properties, suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer's yeast to grow. After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded.

===Migrant labor and social impact===
[[File:Kratky, Frantisek - Sklizen chmele (ca 1898).jpg|thumb|Hops harvest in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] (1898)]]
[[File:NMA.0063746 Humleplockning mellan Vånga och Näsum.jpg|thumb|Hops harvest in [[Skåne]], [[Sweden]] in 1937]]

The need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop-growing had a big social impact. Around the world, the labor-intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest. Whole families would partake and live in [[hopper hut|hoppers' huts]], with even the smallest children helping in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~hunny.pot/homepage/hopping.html |title=Connie's Homepage - Hop Picking in Kent |publisher=Btinternet.com |accessdate=2012-05-20 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721103026/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.btinternet.com%2F%7Ehunny.pot%2Fhomepage%2Fhopping.html |archivedate=21 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/hop-picking/ |title=George Orwell: Hop-picking |publisher=Theorwellprize.co.uk |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham's ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' and a large part of George Orwell's ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'' contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest.  In England, many of those picking hops in [[Kent]] were from eastern areas of London. This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside. People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] area of Worcestershire. Some photographs have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Keith. ''Around Malvern in old photographs.''. Alan Sutton Publishing, Gloucester. {{ISBN|0-86299-587-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in Kent, because of a shortage of small-denomination coin of the realm, many growers issued their own currency to those doing the labor. In some cases, the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images, making them quite beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/opac/search/cataloguedetail.html?&amp;priref=94347&amp;_function_=xslt&amp;_limit_=10#1 |title=Charles Levett Hop Tokens, 60 Bushels Denomination, The Fitzwilliam Museum, fitzmuseum.cam.ack.uk |publisher=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[Prohibition]] had a major impact on hops productions, but remnants of this significant industry in West and Northwest US are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive throughout Sonoma County, among others. Florian Dauenhauer, of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] in Sonoma County, became a manufacturer of hop-harvesting machines in 1940, in part because of the hop industry's importance to the county. This mechanization helped destroy the local industry by enabling large-scale mechanized production, which moved to larger farms in other areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;DauenhauerPD&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

==Chemical composition==
In addition to water, cellulose, and various proteins, the chemical composition of hops consists of compounds important for imparting character to beer.&lt;ref name=schon/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Verzele 32–48&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 100 Years of Hop Chemistry and Its Relevance to Brewing|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2050-0416.1986.tb04372.x/abstract|journal = Journal of the Institute of Brewing|date = 1986-01-02|issn = 2050-0416|pages = 32–48|volume = 92|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/j.2050-0416.1986.tb04372.x|first = M.|last = Verzele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpha acids ===
[[File:Reaction-degradation-humulone.png|thumb|Isomerization scheme of humulone]]

Probably the most important chemical compound within hops are the alpha acids or [[Humulone|humulones.]] During wort boiling, the humulones are thermally isomerized into iso-alpha acids or [[Isohumulone|''isohumulones'']], which are responsible for the bitter taste of beer.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Keukeleire 108–112&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fundamentals of beer and hop chemistry|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0100-40422000000100019&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Química Nova|issn = 0100-4042|pages = 108–112|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1590/S0100-40422000000100019|first = Denis|last = De Keukeleire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lupulone.svg|thumb|Structure of lupulone (beta acid)]]

=== Beta acids ===
Hops contain beta acids or lupulones sensitive to oxidative decomposition which may be detrimental to the taste of beer. For this reason, beta acids are considered a negative factor in brewing and many brewers usually choose hops with a low beta acid content.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Keukeleire 108–112&quot;/&gt;

=== Essential oils ===
The main components of hops essential oils are [[terpene]] [[hydrocarbon]]s consisting of  [[myrcene]], [[humulene]] and [[caryophyllene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Verzele 32–48&quot;/&gt; Myrcene is responsible for the pungent smell of fresh hops. Humulene and its oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma. Together, myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene represent 80 to 90% of the total hops essential oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verzele 32–48&quot;/&gt;

=== Flavonoids ===
[[File:8-prenylnaringenin.png|thumb|Chemical structure of 8-prenylnaringenin]]

[[Xanthohumol]] is the principal flavonoid in hops. The other well-studied [[prenylflavonoid]]s are [[8-Prenylnaringenin|8-prenylnaringenin]] and [[isoxanthohumol]].

Undried or &quot;wet&quot; hops are sometimes (since ca.1990) used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_10422358 | work=Denver Post | first=Elizabeth | last=Aguilera | title=Hop harvest yields hip beer for brewer | date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Kristin.

The [[wort]] (sugar-rich liquid produced from [[malt]]) is boiled with hops before it is cooled down and yeast is added, to start fermentation.

The effect of hops on the finished beer varies by type and use, though there are two main hop types: bittering and aroma.&lt;ref name=schon/&gt; Bittering hops have higher concentrations of alpha acids, and are responsible for the large majority of the bitter flavor of a beer. European (so-called &quot;noble&quot;) hops typically average 5–9% alpha acids by weight (AABW), and the newer American [[cultivar]]s typically range from 8–19% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration of alpha acids (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and (nonbitter) flavor. Bittering hops are boiled for a longer period of time, typically 60–90 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the alpha acids. They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the aromatic compounds evaporate off during the boil.

The degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which [[alpha acid]]s are [[isomer]]ized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in [[International Bitterness Units scale|International Bitterness Units]]. Unboiled hops are only mildly [[bitter (taste)|bitter]]. On the other hand, the nonbitter flavor and aroma of hops come from the essential oils, which evaporate during the boil.

Aroma hops are typically added to the wort later to prevent the evaporation of the essential oils, to impart &quot;hop taste&quot; (if during the final 30 minutes of boil) or &quot;hop aroma&quot; (if during the final 10 minutes, or less, of boil). {{anchor|DryHopping}}Aroma hops are often added after the wort has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as &quot;dry hopping&quot;, which contributes to the hop aroma. [[Farnesene]] is a major component in some hops.&lt;ref name=schon/&gt; The composition of hop essential oils can differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having a significant influence on flavor and aroma.&lt;ref name=schon/&gt;

Today, a substantial amount of &quot;dual-use&quot; hops are used, as well. These have high concentrations of alpha acids and good aromatic properties. These can be added to the boil at any time, depending on the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;

Many [[pale lager]]s have fairly low hop influence, while lagers marketed as [[Pilsener]] or brewed in the Czech Republic may have noticeable noble hop aroma. Certain [[ale]]s (particularly the highly hopped style known as [[India Pale Ale]], or IPA) can have high levels of hop bitterness.

Brewers may use [[software]] tools to control the bittering levels in the boil and adjust recipes to account for a change in the hop bill or seasonal variations in the crop that may lead to the need to compensate for a difference in alpha acid contribution. Data may be shared with other brewers via [[BeerXML]] allowing the reproduction of a recipe allowing for differences in hop availability.

==Varieties==
{{Main article|List of hop varieties}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2014}}

===Breeding programs===
There are many different varieties of hops used in brewing today. Historically, hops varieties were identified by geography (such as Hallertau, Spalt, and Tettnang from Germany), by the farmer who is recognized as first cultivating them (such as Goldings or Fuggles from England), or by their growing habit (e. g., Oregon Cluster).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/121/bh-121-094.htm|title=Brewery History: 121, pp. 94-112|website=www.breweryhistory.com|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Around 1900, a number of institutions began to experiment with breeding specific hop varieties. The breeding program at [[Wye College]] in [[Wye, Kent]] was started in 1904 and rose to prominence through the work of Prof. [[E. S. Salmon]]. Salmon released [[List of hop varieties#Brewer's Gold|Brewer's Gold]] and Brewer's Favorite for commercial cultivation in 1934, and went on to release more than two dozen new cultivars before his death in 1959. Brewer's Gold has become the ancestor of the bulk of new hop releases around the world since its release.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBD APac&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishhops.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Asia-Pacific-Final-Paper.pdf |title=What makes British Hops Unique in the world of Hop Growing? |last1=Capper |first1=Allison |last2=Darby |first2=Peter |date=24 March 2014 |website=British Hop Association |accessdate=4 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725154905/http://www.britishhops.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Asia-Pacific-Final-Paper.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wye College continued its breeding program and again received attention in the 1970s, when Dr. Ray A. Neve released Wye [[List of hop varieties#Target|Target]], Wye [[Challenger hop|Challenger]], Wye [[List of hop varieties#Northdown|Northdown]], Wye [[List of hop varieties#Saxon|Saxon]] and Wye [[List of hop varieties#Yeoman|Yeoman]]. More recently, Wye College and its successor institution Wye Hops Ltd., have focused on breeding the first [[dwarfing|dwarf]] hop varieties, which are easier to pick by machine and far more economical to grow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit Hops History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/ |title=History of Hops |website=British Hop Association |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wye College have also been responsible for breeding hop varieties that will grow with only 12 hours of daily light for the South African hop farmers. Wye College was closed in 2009 but the legacy of their hop breeding programs, particularly that of the dwarf varieties, is continuing as already the U.S.A. private and public breeding programs are using their stock material.

Particular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles, for example [[pale lager]]s are usually brewed with European (often German, Polish or Czech) noble hop varieties such as [[Saaz hops|Saaz]], Hallertau and Strissel Spalt. [[Beer in England|British ales]] use hop varieties such as Fuggles, Goldings and W.G.V. [[Beer in the United States|North American beers]] often use [[Cascade hops]], Columbus hops, Centennial hops, Willamette, [[Amarillo hops]] and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new hop varieties, including dwarf hop varieties.

Hops from New Zealand, such as Pacific Gem, Motueka and Nelson Sauvin, are used in a &quot;Pacific Pale Ale&quot; style of beer with increasing production in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontrade.co.uk/Backissues/Totp2014/files/assets/common/downloads/The_OnTrade_Preview_2014.pdf|title=On Trade Preview 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ontrade.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Noble hops===
[[File:Hopfengarten.jpg|thumb|right|Mature hops growing in a hop yard in Germany]]

The term &quot;noble hops&quot; traditionally refers to varieties of hops which are low in bitterness and high in [[aroma]]. They are the European [[cultivar]]s or races Hallertau, Tettnanger, Spalt, and [[Saaz hops|Saaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.czhops.cz/index.php/en |title=Hop growers union of the Czech Republic |publisher=Czhops.cz |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their low relative bitterness but strong aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European-style [[lager]]s, such as [[Pilsener]], [[Dunkel]], and [[Märzen|Oktoberfest/Märzen]]. In beer, they are considered aroma hops (as opposed to bittering hops); see [[Pilsner Urquell]] as a classic example of the Bohemian Pilsener style, which showcases noble hops.

As with grapes, the location where hops are grown affects the hops' characteristics. Much as [[Dortmunder (beer)|Dortmunder beer]] may within the EU be labelled &quot;Dortmunder&quot; only if it has been brewed in [[Dortmund]], noble hops may officially be considered &quot;noble&quot; only if they were grown in the areas for which the hop varieties ([[Race (biology)|races]]) were named.

* '''Hallertau''' or '''Hallertauer''' – The original German lager hop; named after [[Hallertau]] or Holledau region in central Bavaria. Due to susceptibility to crop disease, it was largely replaced by [[Hersbruck]]er in the 1970s and 1980s. (Alpha acid 3.5–5.5% / beta acid 3–4%)
* '''Žatec (Saaz)''' – Noble hop, named after [[Žatec]] town, used extensively in Bohemia to flavor pale Czech lagers such as [[Pilsner Urquell]]. Soft aroma and bitterness. (Alpha acid 3–4.5% /Beta acid 3–4.5%)
* '''Spalt''' – Traditional German noble hop from the [[Spalt]]er region south of Nuremberg. With a delicate, spicy aroma. (Alpha acid 4–5% / beta acid 4–5%)
* '''Tettnang''' – Comes from [[Tettnang]], a small town in southern [[Baden-Württemberg]] in Germany. The region produces significant quantities of hops, and ships them to [[brewery|breweries]] throughout the world. Noble German dual-use hop used in European pale lagers, sometimes with Hallertau. Soft bitterness. (Alpha acid 3.5–5.5% / beta acid 3.5–5.5%)

English noble varieties are Fuggle, East Kent Goldings and Goldings. They are characterized through analysis as having an alpha:beta ratio of 1:1, low alpha-acid levels (2–5%) with a low cohumulone content, low myrcene in the hop oil, high humulene in the oil, a ratio of humulene:caryophyllene above three, and poor storability resulting in them being more prone to oxidation. In reality, this means they have a relatively consistent bittering potential as they age, due to beta-acid oxidation, and a flavour that improves as they age during periods of poor storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byo.com/stories/article/indices/18-brewing-science/853-hop-chemistry-homebrew-science |title=Hop Chemistry: Homebrew Science |publisher=Byo.com |date=2000-04-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beverages===
In addition to beer, hops are also used in [[herbal tea]]s and in soft drinks. These soft drinks include [[Julmust]] (a carbonated beverage similar to soda that is popular in Sweden during December), [[Malta (soft drink)|Malta]] (a [[Latin American]] soft drink) and [[kvass]].

'''Huey''', '''Dewey''', and '''Louie Duck''' are [[Multiple birth|triplet]] cartoon characters created in 1937 by writer [[Ted Osborne]] and cartoonist [[Al Taliaferro]], and are owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the nephews of [[Donald Duck]] and the grandnephews of [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Like their uncles, the boys are anthropomorphic [[American Pekin duck|white ducks]] with yellow-orange bills and feet. They typically wear shirts and colorful baseball caps, which are sometimes used to differentiate each character. Huey, Dewey and Louie have made several animated appearances in both films and television, but comics remain their primary medium. The trio are collectively the 11th most published comic book characters in the world, and outside of the superhero genre, second only to Donald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/characters/?letter=&amp;gender=&amp;sortBy=appearance&amp;___movies=&amp;___publishers=&amp;___friends=&amp;___enemies=&amp;___teams= Comic Vine], retrieved 31 October 2014. (Character database was searched by most appearances.)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the boys were originally created as mischief-makers to provoke Donald's famous temper, later appearances showed them to be valuable assets to him and Scrooge on their adventures. All three of the boys are members of the fictional [[scouting]] organization the [[Junior Woodchucks]].

==Origins==
[[File:HDL debut 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Final panel of 1937 Sunday newspaper strip ''Donald Duck'' that introduced Donald's nephews; drawn by [[Al Taliaferro]]]]

Officially Huey, Dewey, and Louie were the idea of [[Al Taliaferro]], the artist for the ''Silly Symphonies'' comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short, ''[[Donald's Nephews]]''. The nephews debuted in Taliaferro's comic strip, which by this time had been renamed ''Donald Duck'', on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of ''Donald's Nephews'' by almost six months. According to Don Rosa, Carl Barks has claimed that in fact they were his creation while working as a writer on Donald Duck animated cartoons in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www10.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=Huey,%20Dewey%20and%20Louie]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2017}} The names were devised by Disney gag man Dana Coty, who took them from [[Huey Long]], [[Thomas Dewey]], and Louis Schmitt, an animator at the Disney Studio in the 1930s and 1940s. Taliaferro's introduction of the nephews emulated the three nephews in the [[Happy Hooligan]] comic strip and was also influenced by Mickey Mouse's nephews, [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Andrae,&quot;The Legacy of Al Taliaferro,&quot; in ''Disney's Four Color Adventures'' vol. 1 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In translations of Disney works the nephews have different local-sounding names that often follow the repetition ([[parachesis]]) of the English names. Examples include Hugo, Paco and Luis (American Spanish); Jorgito, Juanito and Jaimito (European Spanish); and Tick, Trick and Track (German).

===Character background===
:''Further information: [[Duck family (Disney)#Della Duck|Duck family (Disney) § Della Duck]] and [[Duck family (Disney)#Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father|§ Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father]]''

Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the sons of Donald's sister Della Duck; in ''Donald's Nephews'', their mother is instead named Dumbella. In the original theatrical shorts, they were originally sent to visit Donald for only one day; in the comics, the three were sent to stay with Donald on a temporary basis, until their father came back from the hospital (the boys ended up sending him there after a [[practical joke]] of putting [[firecracker]]s under his chair). According to a published Duck family tree, their full names are Huebert, Deuteronomy and Louis.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In both the comics and animated shorts, the boys' parents were never heard from or mentioned again after these instances, with the boys ending up permanently living with Donald. All four of them live in the fictional city of [[Donald Duck universe#Duckburg|Duckburg]], in the fictional state of Calisota.

The three ducklings are noted for their identical appearances and personalities. A running joke involves the three sometimes even finishing each other's sentences. In the theatrical shorts, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often behave in a rambunctious and mischievous manner, and they sometimes commit retaliation or revenge on their uncle Donald Duck. In the comics, however, as developed by [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Carl Barks]], the young ducks are more usually portrayed as well-behaved, preferring to assist their uncle Donald Duck and great-uncle [[Scrooge McDuck]] in the adventure at hand. In the early Barks comics, the ducklings were still wild and unruly, but their character improved considerably due to their membership in the [[Junior Woodchucks]] and the good influence of their wise old great-grandmother [[Elvira Coot]] &quot;Grandma&quot; Duck. According to Don Rosa, Huey, Dewey and Louie became members of the Junior Woodchucks when they were around 11 years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://duckman.pettho.com/characters/hdl.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colors of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's outfits===
[[File:Return to Plain Awful - Huey Dewey and Louie.jpg|thumb|[[Self-referential humor]]: Scrooge with Huey, Dewey, and Louie in &quot;[[Return to Plain Awful]]&quot; (1989) by Don Rosa]]

In early comic books and shorts, the caps of Huey, Dewey, and Louie were colored randomly, depending on the whim of the colorist.

On few occasions until 1945 and most every cartoon short afterward, all three nephews wore identical outfits (most commonly red). It wasn't until the 1980s when it became established that Huey is dressed in [[red]], Dewey in [[blue]], and Louie in [[green]]. Disney's archivist [[Dave Smith (archivist)|Dave Smith]], in &quot;Disney A to Z,&quot; said, &quot;Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green.&quot; A few random combinations appear in early Disney merchandise and books, such as orange and yellow. Another combination that shows up from time to time is Huey in blue, Dewey in green, and Louie in red. In-story, this inconsistency is explained away as a result of the ducklings borrowing each other's clothes.

In Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge comics the trio have occasionally been known to dress in their usual outfits, but rather than have their usual colors they all wear black (or the same dark color), rendering them visually identical, leaving their hat color available if they care to be distinguished.

One story in Donald Duck comics was based around Donald spending so much time trying to tell his three nephews apart that he developed a heightened sense of sight.

===Voices===
[[Clarence Nash]], Donald's voice actor, gave the voices to the boys in the cartoon shorts, making them just as unintelligible as Donald's. Huey, Dewey, and Louie were all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in ''DuckTales''. In ''Quack Pack'', they were voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]], [[Pamela Segall]], and [[Elizabeth Daily]], respectively. [[Tony Anselmo]] voiced the characters in ''Down and Out with Donald Duck'' (1987), ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', but Russi Taylor still voices the trio in other projects, such as the video games ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Speedway USA]]'', and the [[direct-to-video]] films ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas|Mickey's Once]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas|Twice Upon a Christmas]]''. Russi Taylor also reprised her role as the nephews in the ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'' video game and the post-2013 ''[[Disney Mickey Mouse|Mickey Mouse]]'' shorts. [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]] are voicing the brothers in the 2017 reboot.

===Phooey Duck===
[[File:Phooey Duck1.gif|thumb|Panel with Huey, Dewey, and Louie along with a fourth nephew, Phooey Duck]]
On a few occasions, an artist by error drew four nephews and the error was not noticed but was published. This fourth nephew has been named '''[[The Duck Family (Disney)#Phooey Duck|Phooey Duck]]''' by Disney comic editor Bob Foster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nafsk.se/pipermail/dcml/2006-January/023922.html Mailing list entry from writer Lars Jensen, near bottom of entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sullivanet.com/duckburg/phooey.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One short [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]]-licensed Disney comic (called ''Much Ado About Phooey'' in English-language version) used Phooey as a character and explained Phooey's sporadic appearances as a freak incident of nature. (The Swedish text in the two speech balloons says &quot;It is a fourth nephew! An exact copy of the others! / Yes, it's probably best that I explain&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://coa.inducks.org/s.php?c=D+97589 Much Ado About Phooey - Indexed]&lt;/ref&gt;

They also appeared with [[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]] but without [[Donald Duck|Donald]] in ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]''.

=== Literature ===
Within the comics, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often play a major role in most stories involving either their uncle Donald or great-uncle Scrooge McDuck, accompanying them on most of their adventures. Also seen in the comics is the boys' membership in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]-like organization, [[the Junior Woodchucks]], including their use of the [[Junior Woodchucks Guidebook]], a manual containing all manner of information on virtually every subject possible (however, there are some resources, such as the ancient libraries of Tralla La, that hold information not found in the guidebook). This excellent youth organization, which has twin goals of preserving knowledge and preserving the environment, was instrumental in transforming the three brothers from little hellions to upstanding young ducks.

In Disney comic writer [[Don Rosa]]'s (unofficial) continuity, Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck were born around 1940 in Duckburg. True to his jocular style, Rosa occasionally makes subtle references to the untold mystery of the three boys' life: What became of their parents? In his epic comic series, ''[[Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', Rosa pictures how Scrooge first met Donald and his nephews, saying: &quot;I'm not used to relatives, either! The few I had seem to have... disappeared!&quot; Huey, Dewey, and Louie answer: &quot;We know how ''that'' feels, Unca Scrooge!&quot;

In ''Some Heir Over the Rainbow'' by Carl Barks, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, along with [[Donald Duck]] and [[Gladstone Gander]], are tested by [[Scrooge McDuck]], who wants to pick an [[heir]] to his fortune. Using the legend of a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, Scrooge secretly gives [[US$]] 3,000 (One thousand to Huey, Dewey, and Louie, another for Gladstone, and the last one for Donald). Donald uses his money for a down payment of a new car, now being $1,000 in debt. Gladstone, considering himself too lucky to need the money this soon, hides the money for when and if he needs it, causing Scrooge to consider him a better option than Donald. Huey, Dewey, and Louie lend their money to a man who claims to need the money to search for a treasure. Initially thinking they were tricked out of the money, Scrooge actually considers leaving his fortune to Gladstone, even though he sees that as ''&quot;an awful injustice to the world&quot;'', but the man actually finds the treasure and pays the kids back. Scrooge makes Huey, Dewey, and Louie his heirs. Although this is disregarded in a number of later comics, it seems to be the most solidly canon indication of Scrooge's plans.

===Television===
====''DuckTales''====
{{Main|DuckTales|DuckTales (2017 TV series)}}
They later starred in the 1987 animated [[television]] series ''[[DuckTales]]'', in which they appeared in adventures with their great-uncle, Scrooge McDuck (Donald having enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]]). The boys' personalities in this series were mainly based on their comic book appearances versus the theatrical shorts.

A new adaptation of the series once again titled, ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]'' features the three brothers as well, albeit with different designs and distinct personalities like in ''Quack Pack'', who move to Scrooge's house with Donald after the boat where they lived is destroyed by accident. In the new installment, the brothers also travel in adventures with Scrooge, now with Donald in tow. The first episode also shows an image of Della, the triplets' mother, who also traveled the world in adventures with Donald and Scrooge. This iteration also changed the boys' full names, having them be called Hubert, Duford, and Loubert, respectively.

====''Quack Pack''====
{{main|Quack Pack}}
[[Image:QuackPack.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Huey, Dewey, and Louie as teenagers in ''[[Quack Pack]]''.]]
Huey, Dewey, and Louie also starred in the 1990s series ''[[Quack Pack]]'', in which the three were portrayed as [[teenager]]s. In ''Quack Pack'', the boys were given distinct personalities, with Huey serving as the group's leader, Dewey as a computer whiz, and Louie as enjoying sports. After ''Quack Pack'', the boys were reverted to their original ages in future appearances, including 2000s series ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', and then re-aged in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. On ''House of Mouse'', they served as the house band in a variety of different styles (most commonly as 'The Quackstreet Boys'). They also feature prominently, in a segment of the computer-animated film, ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' from 2004.

===Video games===
Huey, Dewey, and Louie appear in the third [[Disney's Magical Quest|''Magical Quest'']] game. The object of the game is to rescue them from the clutches of the [[villain]]ous [[Pete (Disney)|King Pete]]. The trio also appear in ''[[Quackshot]]'' piloting Donald's plane as he travels the world in search of a lost treasure.

They also appear in ''[[The Lucky Dime Caper]]'' for the Sega Master system, where they are kidnapped by Magica De Spell. Donald must find Scrooge's lucky dime and barter for their safety.

They also appear in ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'', aiding Donald to rescue Daisy and beat Gladstone to her, while he rescues their hexed play toys.

They even appear in ''[[Mickey's Speedway USA]]'' as unlockable lightweight characters.

They also appear in [[DuckTales (video game)|''DuckTales'']], aiding their Uncle Scrooge in finding treasure.

They also appear on ''[[Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Mix]]'', where they appear as [[DJ]]'s on certain music tracks

====''Kingdom Hearts''====
In ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' they work in the item shop in the First District of Traverse Town. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', they individually run an item shop (Huey), a weapon shop (Louie), and an accessory shop (Dewey) in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden. In both endings, they are all seen going back to Disney Castle. They reappear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep]]'' in Disney Town, recreating Ice Cream flavors, this time with a speaking role. They appear once more in the mobile game ''[[Kingdom Hearts Unchained]]'' as special Support medals that grant the player's other medals a set amount of experience points based on the medal's star value.

===Parks and attractions===
Huey, Dewey and Louie appear as characters only at [[Tokyo Disney]] and [[Disneyland Paris]].

====Tokyo Disney====
Huey, Dewey and Louie only appeared in seasonal Parades Easter, Halloween and Christmas 2011 after a long absence. They also appeared in the Countdown Party Parade 2011.

====Disneyland Paris====
Huey, Dewey and Louie appear more regularly in Paris. They appeared during the Christmas season 2010 in their daytime and nighttime Parades at the Disneyland Park ''&quot;[[Disneyland Paris]]'s Magic Kingdom&quot;'' [[Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade]] and in the [[Disney's Fantillusion]] Parade in glittery outfits. They made another appearance at [[Disneyland Paris]] for meet and greet at the [[Disneyland Hotel (Paris)|Disneyland Hotel]] on April 2, 2011 the day of the Press Event for the launch of their new season &quot;Magical Moments Festival&quot;. They also appeared at the Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade at the [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] in special outfits for the Parade and at the Disney's Stars 'n' Cars Parade at the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in a unique directors outfits.

The Three Nephews appeared at [[Disneyland Paris]]'s Halloween season 2011. they have their own show during &quot;Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Parties&quot; at the [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] in [[Disneyland Paris]], titled &quot;Huey, Dewey and Louie's Trick or Treat Party&quot;. They also made an appearance for meet and greet at [[Disneyland Paris]]'s &quot;Disney's Halloween Party&quot; on October 31, 2011. This is the first time ever that the three nephews appear for meet and greet at any of the Disney Parks for regular park guests. They were also part of the Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve 2011/2012 celebrations at the [[Disneyland Hotel (Paris)|Disneyland Hotel]].

==Cultural influences==
*In the 1972 science fiction film ''[[Silent Running]]'' directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]], the main character, Lowell, befriends three robot drones and renames them Huey, Dewey and Louie. Coincidentally, the drones appear in their semi-official colors: Huey is reddish-orange, Dewey is blue and Louie is green.
*In the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television series ''[[Due South]]'', two of the detectives at the [[Chicago Police Department]] where the series takes place are named Jack Huey and Louis (Louie) Gardino. After season two, Gardino is replaced by Detective Thomas Dewey. They are often referred to as &quot;the duck boys&quot; by other characters.
*In [[Finland]], the three main political parties, namely the [[National Coalition Party]], the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], are sometimes [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] referred as ''Huey, Dewey, and Louie'', for there are allegedly no differences in their [[political agenda]]s. The joke is based on the fact that the parties use the same symbolic colours (blue&amp;nbsp;– NCP, green&amp;nbsp;– Centre, red&amp;nbsp;– Social Democrats) as the three ducks' caps.
*In the ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' episode &quot;Waltz for Venus,&quot; Spike and Faye capture three minor bounty heads named Louey, Huey, and Dewey.
*They all appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode &quot;Some like it Hitman&quot; voiced by [[Seth Green]] (Huey and Dewey) and Sam Kwasman (Louie). In that sketch, they ask their Uncle Donald (also voiced by Kwasman) if they can see their mom ([[Della Duck]]) again.
*The three prototypes of the MooresCloud [[ambient device]]s were named &quot;Huey, Dewey and Louie&quot; when first presented to the tech press in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] by futurist [[Mark Pesce]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.moorescloud.com/2012/10/12/meet-the-press/&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', [[Boss Hogg]] has a nephew called Hughie Hogg (who appears in several episodes from season two onwards) while Boss Hogg's big brother Louie Hogg appears in season six's &quot;How To Succeed In Hazzard.&quot;
*In the 1988 post-apocalyptic role playing game ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', the player's [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] can neutralize a gang led by triplets named Huey, Dewey and Louie.

The name ''Hammurabi'' derives from the [[Amorite language|Amorite]] term ''ʻAmmurāpi'' (&quot;the kinsman is a healer&quot;), itself from ''ʻAmmu'' (&quot;paternal kinsman&quot;) and ''Rāpi'' (&quot;healer&quot;).

[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in {{circa|1792 BC}} and upon his death in {{circa|1750 BC}}]]
Hammurabi was an [[Amorite]] [[First Babylonian Dynasty|First Dynasty]] king of the [[city-state]] of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], in {{circa|1792 BC}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi.&lt;ref name=&quot;VM3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding. However his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VM3&quot; /&gt;

Thus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation. The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta. To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]] which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful. Hammurabi used his power to undertake a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{circa|1801 BC}}, the powerful kingdom of Elam, which straddled important trade routes across the [[Zagros Mountains]], invaded the Mesopotamian plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Eshnunna, destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of Larsa.&lt;ref name=&quot;VM18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammurabi and the king of Larsa made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity and were able to crush the Elamites, although Larsa did not contribute greatly to the military effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;VM18&quot; /&gt; Angered by Larsa's failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by {{circa|1763 BC}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;VM31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hammurabi was assisted during the war in the south by his allies from the north such as [[Yamhad]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;VM31&quot; /&gt; Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although it is possible that the conquest of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ar45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammurabi entered into a protracted war with [[Ishme-Dagan I]] of Assyria for control of Mesopotamia, with both kings making alliances with minor states in order to gain the upper hand. Eventually Hammurabi prevailed, ousting Ishme-Dagan I just before his own death. [[Mut-Ashkur]] the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly.

In just a few years, Hammurabi succeeded in uniting all of Mesopotamia under his rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ar45&quot; /&gt; The Assyrian kingdom survived but was forced to pay tribute during his reign, and of the major city-states in the region, only [[Yamhad|Aleppo]] and [[Qatna]] to the west in the [[Levant]] maintained their independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ar45&quot; /&gt; However, one stele of Hammurabi has been found as far north as [[Diyarbekir]], where he claims the title &quot;King of the Amorites&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire of the Amorites|author=Clay, Albert Tobias|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1919|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vast numbers of contract [[Clay tablet|tablets]], dated to the reigns of Hammurabi and his successors, have been discovered, as well as 55 of his own letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|2003|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; These letters give a glimpse into the daily trials of ruling an empire, from dealing with floods and mandating changes to a flawed [[calendar]], to taking care of Babylon's massive herds of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|2003|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammurabi died and passed the reins of the empire on to his son [[Samsu-iluna]] in {{circa|1750 BC}}, under whose rule the Babylonian empire began to quickly unravel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Code of laws ==
{{Main|Code of Hammurabi}}
[[File:P1050763 Louvre code Hammurabi face rwk.JPG|thumb|upright=1|[[Code of Hammurabi]] stele. [[The Louvre|Louvre Museum]], Paris]]
The Code of Hammurabi was inscribed on a [[stele]] and placed in a public place so that all could see it, although it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, [[Susa]]; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in [[Iran]] and is now in the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]]. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by [[scribe]]s on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|2003|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the code is very specific, with each offense receiving a specified punishment. The punishments tended to be very harsh by modern standards, with many offenses resulting in death, disfigurement, or the use of the &quot;[[Eye for an Eye|Eye for eye, tooth for tooth]]&quot; ([[An eye for an eye|Lex Talionis]] &quot;Law of Retaliation&quot;) philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3153895 &quot;Review: The Code of Hammurabi,&quot; J. Dyneley Prince, ''The American Journal of Theology'' Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jul., 1904), pp. 601–609 Published by: The University of Chicago Press]&lt;/ref&gt; The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of [[presumption of innocence]], and it also suggests that the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Victimology: Theories and Applications'', Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr, Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no provision for [[extenuating circumstances]] to alter the prescribed punishment.

A carving at the top of the stele portrays Hammurabi receiving the laws from [[Shamash]], the Babylonian god of justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleiner|first1=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|date=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-495-57360-9|volume=1|page=29|edition=Thirteenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBrvazPDFoYC&amp;pg=PT61&amp;dq=Hammurabi+code+Shamash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqmKyQ0bLXAhWn3YMKHbLyCvYQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Hammurabi%20code%20Shamash&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=J.

[[Lipit-Ishtar|Code of Lipit-Ishtar]], and the later [[Hittite laws|Hittite code of laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Codes of Hammurabi and Moses|author=Davies, W. W.|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|date=January 2003|isbn=0-7661-3124-6|oclc=227972329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example laws in Hammurabi's code ===
:(Text taken from Harper's translation, [[s:The Code of Hammurabi (Harper translation)|readable on wikisource]])
* §&amp;nbsp;8 – If any one steal cattle or sheep, or an ass, or a pig or a goat, if it belong to a god or to the court, the thief shall pay thirtyfold therefor; if they belonged to a freed man of the king he shall pay tenfold; if the thief has nothing with which to pay he shall be put to death.

If it cause the death of a slave of the owner of the house, he shall give the owner of the house a slave of equal value. If it destroy property, he shall restore whatever it destroyed, and because he did not make the house which he built firm and it collapsed, he shall rebuild the house which collapsed from his own property (i.e., at his own expense).

During the reign of Hammurabi, Babylon usurped the position of &quot;most holy city&quot; in southern Mesopotamia from its predecessor, [[Nippur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Schneider|first=Tammi J.|title=An Introduction to Ancient Mesopotamian Religion|publisher=William B.

In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, {{circa|1740 BC}}. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''coup de grace'' for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful [[Hittite Empire]], thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=&quot;D19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|DeBlois|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, a people speaking a [[language isolate]], from the [[Zagros mountains]] region. This [[Kassite Dynasty]] ruled Babylon for over 400 years&lt;ref name=&quot;D19&quot;/&gt; and adopted many aspects of the Babylonian [[culture]], including Hammurabi's code of laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;D19&quot;/&gt;

In the early twentieth century, many scholars believed that Hammurabi was [[Amraphel]], the King of [[Shinar]] in the Book of Genesis 14:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1440-amraphel|title=AMRAPHEL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2014&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 14 - New International Version|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has now been largely rejected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=North|first=Robert|editor1-last=Metzger|editor1-first=Bruce M.|editor2-last=Coogan|editor2-first=Michael D.|date=1993|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=5|chapter=Abraham|isbn=0-19-504645-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Granerød2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Granerød|first=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5mlvNPexSEC&amp;pg=PA114|date=26 March 2010|location=Berlin, Germany|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-022346-0|page=120|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amraphael's existence is not attested in any writings from outside the Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granerød2010&quot;/&gt;

Because of Hammurabi's reputation as a lawgiver, his depiction can be found in several [[United States|U.S.]] government buildings. Hammurabi is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in [[marble]] [[bas-relief]]s in the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|chamber]] of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-19|url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/lawgivers/hammurabi.cfm|title=Hammurabi|publisher=[[Architect of the Capitol]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[frieze]] by [[Adolph Weinman]] depicting the &quot;great lawgivers of history&quot;, including Hammurabi, is on the south wall of the [[United States Supreme Court building|U.S. Supreme Court building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-19 |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/north&amp;southwalls.pdf |title=Courtroom Friezes |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601113942/https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/north%26southwalls.pdf |archivedate=June 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of [[Saddam Hussein]], the [[Iraqi Army]]'s [[1st Hammurabi Armoured Division]] was named after the ancient king as part of an effort to 
emphasize the connection between modern Iraq and the pre-Arab Mesopotamian cultures.

The '''Huygens–Fresnel principle''' (named after [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[France|French]] physicist [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]) is a method of analysis applied to problems of [[wave propagation]] both in the [[Far-field diffraction pattern|far-field limit]] and in near-field [[diffraction]]. It states that every point on a [[wavefront]] is itself the source of spherical [[wavelet]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MathPages&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Huygens' Principle | website=MathPages | url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath242/kmath242.htm | access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- [[File:Huygens Fresnel Principle.gif|thumb|[[Diffraction]] of a plane wave at a slit whose width is several times the wavelength.]] --&gt;
[[File:Wavelength=slitwidth.gif|thumb|[[Diffraction]] of a plane wave when the slit width equals the wavelength]]
In 1678, Huygens&lt;ref&gt;Chr. Huygens, ''Traité de la Lumière'' (drafted 1678; published in Leyden by Van der Aa, 1690), translated by Silvanus P. Thompson as ''[https://archive.org/details/treatiseonlight031310mbp Treatise on Light]'' (London: Macmillan, 1912; [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14725 Project Gutenberg edition], 2005), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that every point to which a luminous disturbance reaches becomes a source of a spherical wave; the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. He assumed that the secondary waves travelled only in the &quot;forward&quot; direction and it is not explained in the theory why this is the case. He was able to provide a qualitative explanation of linear and spherical wave propagation, and to derive the laws of reflection and refraction using this principle, but could not explain the deviations from rectilinear propagation that occur when light encounters edges, apertures and screens, commonly known as [[diffraction]] effects.&lt;ref name = &quot;Insight into Optics&quot;&gt;OS Heavens and RW Ditchburn, ''Insight into Optics'', 1987, Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester {{ISBN|0-471-92769-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of this error was finally explained by David A.B. Miller in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;David A. B. Miller ''[https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~dabm/146.pdf Huygens's wave propagation principle corrected],'' Optics Letters  16, pp. 1370-2 (1991). {{doi|10.1364/OL.16.001370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution is that the source is a dipole (not the monopole assumed by Huygens), which cancels in the reflected direction.

In 1818, Fresnel&lt;ref&gt;A. Fresnel, &quot;M&amp;eacute;moire sur la diffraction de la lumi&amp;egrave;re&quot; (deposited 1818, &quot;crowned&quot; 1819), in ''Oeuvres compl&amp;egrave;tes'' (Paris: Imprimerie imp&amp;eacute;riale, 1866&amp;ndash;70), vol.1, pp.&amp;nbsp;247&amp;ndash;363; partly translated as &quot;Fresnel's prize memoir on the diffraction of light&quot;, in H.&amp;nbsp;Crew (ed.), ''The Wave Theory of Light: Memoirs by Huygens, Young and Fresnel'', American Book Co., 1900, [https://archive.org/details/wavetheoryofligh00crewrich archive.org/details/wavetheoryofligh00crewrich], pp.&amp;nbsp;81&amp;ndash;144. (Not to be confused with the earlier work of the same title in ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 1:238&amp;ndash;81, 1816.)&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Huygens' principle, together with his own principle of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] could explain both the rectilinear propagation of light and also diffraction effects. To obtain agreement with experimental results, he had to include additional arbitrary assumptions about the phase and amplitude of the secondary waves, and also an obliquity factor. These assumptions have no obvious physical foundation but led to predictions that agreed with many experimental observations, including the [[Arago spot]].

[[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] was a member of the French Academy, which reviewed Fresnel's work.&lt;ref name = &quot;Born and Wolf&quot;&gt;[[Max Born]] and Emil Wolf, ''Principles of Optics'', 1999, Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|978-0-521-64222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used Fresnel's theory to predict that a bright spot ought to appear in the center of the shadow of a small disc, and deduced from this that the theory was incorrect. However, Arago, another member of the committee, performed the experiment and showed that the prediction was correct. (Lisle had actually observed this fifty years earlier.&lt;ref name = &quot;Insight into Optics&quot;/&gt;) This was one of the investigations that led to the victory of the wave theory of light over the then predominant [[corpuscular theory]].

The Huygens–Fresnel principle provides a good basis for understanding and predicting the classical wave propagation of light. However, there are limitations to the principle and differing views as to whether it is an accurate representation of reality or whether &quot;Huygens' principle actually does give the right answer but for the wrong reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath242/kmath242.htm Huygens' Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;  See Huygens' Theory and the Modern Photon Wavefunction below.

[[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula]] provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for diffraction, based on the wave equation. The arbitrary assumptions made by Fresnel to arrive at the Huygens–Fresnel equation emerge automatically from the mathematics in this derivation.&lt;ref&gt;MV Klein &amp; TE Furtak, ''Optics'', 1986, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example of the operation of the principle can be seen when two rooms are connected by an open doorway and a sound is produced in a remote corner of one of them. A person in the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the doorway. As far as the second room is concerned, the vibrating air in the doorway is the source of the sound.

==Mathematical expression of the principle==
[[Image:Huygens-Fresnel BW.svg|thumb|300px|right|Geometric arrangement for Fresnel's calculation]]
Consider the case of a point source located at a point '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, vibrating at a [[frequency]] ''f''. The disturbance may be described by a complex variable ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; known as the [[complex amplitude]]. It produces a spherical wave with [[wavelength]] λ, [[wavenumber]] ''k'' = 2π/λ. The complex amplitude of the primary wave at the point '''Q''' located at a distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;U(r_0) = \frac {U_0 e^{ikr_0}}{r_0} &lt;/math&gt;

since the [[amplitude|magnitude]] decreases in inverse proportion to the distance travelled, and the phase changes as ''k'' times the distance travelled.

Using Huygens' theory and the [[superposition principle|principle of superposition]] of waves, the complex amplitude at a further point '''P''' is found by summing the contributions from each point on the sphere of radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to get agreement with experimental results, Fresnel found that the individual contributions from the secondary waves on the sphere had to be multiplied by a constant, −''i''/λ, and by an additional inclination factor, ''K''(χ). The first assumption means that the secondary waves oscillate at a quarter of a cycle out of phase with respect to the primary wave, and that the magnitude of the secondary waves are in a ratio of 1:λ to the primary wave. He also assumed that ''K''(χ) had a maximum value when χ = 0, and was equal to zero when χ = π/2. The complex amplitude at '''P''' is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt; U(P) = -\frac{i}{\lambda} U(r_0) \int_{S} \frac {e^{iks}}{s} K(\chi)\,dS &lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' describes the surface of the sphere, and ''s'' is the distance between '''Q''' and '''P'''. 
 
Fresnel used a zone construction method to find approximate values of ''K'' for the different zones,&lt;ref name = &quot;Born and Wolf&quot;/&gt; which enabled him to make predictions that were in agreement with experimental results.

The various assumptions made by Fresnel emerge automatically in [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Born and Wolf&quot;/&gt; to which the Huygens–Fresnel principle can be considered to be an approximation. Kirchhoff gave the following expression for ''K''(χ):

:&lt;math&gt;~K(\chi )= \frac{1}{2}(1+\cos \chi)&lt;/math&gt;

''K'' has a maximum value at χ = 0 as in the Huygens–Fresnel principle; however, ''K'' is not equal to zero at χ = π/2.

==Huygens' theory and the modern photon wavefunction==
Huygens' theory served as a fundamental explanation of the wave nature of light interference and was further developed by Fresnel and Young but did not fully resolve all observations such as the low-intensity double-slit experiment that was first performed by G. I. Taylor in 1909, see [[double-slit experiment]].  It was not until the early and mid 1900s that quantum theory discussions, particularly the early discussions at the 1927 Brussels [[Solvay Conference]], where [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed his de Broglie hypothesis that the photon is guided by a wavefunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=The Quantum Story|date=2011|publisher=Oxford Press|isbn=978-0-19-965597-7|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wavefunction presents a much different explanation of the observed light and dark bands in a double slit experiment.  Feynman partially explains that a photon will follow a predetermined path which is a choice of one of many possible paths.  These chosen paths form the pattern; in dark areas no photons are landing and in bright areas many photons are landing.  The path of the photon or its chosen wavefunction is determined by the surroundings: the photons originating point (atom), the slit and the screen, the wavefunction is a solution to this geometry.  The wavefunction approach was further proven by additional double-slit experiments in Italy and Japan in the 1970s and 1980s with electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peter|first1=Rodgers|title=The double-slit experiment|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/2002/sep/01/the-double-slit-experiment|website=www.physicsworld.com|publisher=Physics World|accessdate=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huygens' principle and quantum field theory==
Huygens' principle can be seen as a consequence of the [[homogenous space|homogeneity]] of space—the space is uniform in all locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;veselov&quot;/&gt; Any disturbance created in a sufficiently small region of homogenous space (or in a homogenous medium) propagates from that region in all geodesic directions. The waves created by this disturbance, in turn, create disturbances in other regions, and so on. The [[superposition principle|superposition]] of all the waves results in the observed pattern of wave propagation.

Homogeneity of space is fundamental to [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) where the [[wave function]] of any object propagates along all available unobstructed paths. When [[partition function (quantum field theory)|integrated along all possible paths]], with a [[Phase (waves)|phase]] factor proportional to the [[action (physics)|action]], the interference of the wave-functions correctly predicts observable phenomena. Every point on the wave front acts as the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in the light cone with the same speed as the wave. The new wave front is found by constructing the surface tangent to the secondary wavelets.

==In other spatial dimensions==
In 1900, [[Jacques Hadamard]] observed that Huygens' principle was broken when the number of spatial dimensions is even.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander P. Veselov, &quot;[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/maths/research/preprints/papers02/02-49.pdf Huygens’ principle]&quot;, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/math220a/handouts/waveequation3.pdf Wave Equation in Higher Dimensions]&quot; Stanford University, Math 220a class notes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Belger, R. Schimming and V. Wünsch, &quot;[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/show_abstract.php?issn=0232-2064&amp;vol=16&amp;iss=1&amp;rank=3 A Survey on Huygens’ Principle]&quot;, ''ZEITSCHRIFT FÜR ANALYSIS UND IHRE ANWENDUNGEN'' '''Volume 16''', Issue 1, 1997, pp. 9–36 DOI: 10.4171/ZAA/747&lt;/ref&gt; From this, he developed a set of conjectures that remain an active topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;Leifur Ásgeirsson, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpa.3160090304/abstract &quot;Some hints on Huygens' principle and Hadamard's conjecture&quot;], ''Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics'', '''Volume 9''', Issue 3, pages 307–326, August 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Günther, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024088 &quot;Huygens’ principle and Hadamard’s conjecture&quot;], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', March 1991, '''Volume 13''', Issue 2, pp 56-63&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it has been discovered that Huygens' principle holds on a large class of [[homogenous space]]s derived from the [[Coxeter group]] (so, for example, the [[Weyl group]]s of simple [[Lie algebra]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;veselov&quot;&gt;Alexander P. Veselov, &quot;[http://anothersample.net/huygens-principle-and-integrable-systems Huygens' principle and integrable systems]&quot;, ''Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena'' '''87''' (1995) 9-13 DOI 10.1016/0167-2789(95)00166-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yu. Yu. Berest, A. P. Veselov, &quot;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01079005#page-1 Hadamard's problem and Coxeter groups: New examples of Huygens' equations]&quot;, ''Functional Analysis and Its Applications'' January 1994, '''Volume 28''', Issue 1, pp 3-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional statement of Huygens' principle for the [[D'Alembertian]] gives rise to the [[KdV hierarchy]], analogously, the [[Dirac operator]] gives rise to the [[AKNS]] hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Fabio A. C. C. Chalub and Jorge P. Zubelli, &quot;[http://cmaf.fc.ul.pt/arquivo/docs/preprints/pdf/2004/2004024.pdf Huygens’ Principle for Hyperbolic Operators and Integrable Hierarchies]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Yu.

Leaving the hive, foraging bees collect sugar-rich flower nectar and return to the hive where they use their &quot;honey stomachs&quot; to ingest and regurgitate the nectar repeatedly until it is partially digested.&lt;ref name=&quot;pnas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=cd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Standifer LN | url = http://maarec.cas.psu.edu/bkCD/HBBiology/nutrition_supplements.htm  | title = Honey Bee Nutrition And Supplemental Feeding | work = Excerpted from &quot;Beekeeping in the United States&quot; | access-date= 14 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bee [[digestive enzymes]] – [[invertase]], [[amylase]], and [[diastase]] – along with [[gastric acid]] hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt;&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes until the product reaches storage quality.&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; It is then placed in honeycomb cells left unsealed while still high in water content (about 20%) and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHB Bee facts&quot;/&gt; The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to circulate air and [[evaporation|evaporate]] water from the honey to a content around 18%, raising the sugar concentration, and preventing [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NHB Bee facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them.&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; As removed from the hive by a [[beekeeper]], honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHB Bee facts&quot;/&gt;

Another source of honey is from a number of wasp species, such as the wasps ''[[Brachygastra lecheguana]]'' and ''[[Brachygastra mellifica]]'', which are found in South and Central America. These species are known to feed on nectar and produce honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Nearctic social wasps of the subfamily polybiinae (Hymenoptera; Vespidae)|last = Bequaert|first = J.Q.|date = 1932|journal = Entomologica Americana|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wasps, such as the ''[[Polistes versicolor]]'', even consume honey themselves, switching from feeding on pollen in the middle of their lifecycles to feeding on honey, which can better provide for their energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britto |first1=Fábio Barros |first2=Flávio Henrique |last2=Caetano |title=Morphological Features and Occurrence of Degenerative Characteristics in the Hypopharyngeal Glands of the Paper Wasp Polistes versicolor (Olivier) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |journal=Micron |volume=37 |issue=8 |year=2006 |pages=742–47 |doi=10.1016/j.micron.2006.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Collection===
[[File:Extractor Beekeeping.jpg|thumb|right|Extraction from a honeycomb]]
[[File:Filtering of honey.jpg|thumb|upright|Filtering from a honeycomb]]

Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from domesticated [[beehive]]s. The honey is stored in honeycombs.  Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a [[honeyguide]] bird.  The bees may first be pacified by using smoke from a [[bee smoker]].  The smoke triggers a feeding instinct (an attempt to save the resources of the hive from a possible fire), making them less aggressive and the smoke obscures the pheromones the bees use to communicate.

The honeycomb is removed from the hive and the honey may be extracted from that, either by crushing or by using a [[honey extractor]]. The honey is then usually filtered to remove beeswax and other debris.

Before the invention of removable frames, bee colonies were often sacrificed to conduct the harvest.  The harvester would take all the available honey and replace the entire colony the next spring.  Since the invention of removable frames, the principles of husbandry lead most beekeepers to ensure that their bees  have enough stores to survive the winter, either by leaving some honey in the beehive or by providing the colony with a honey substitute such as sugar water or crystalline sugar (often in the form of a &quot;candyboard&quot;).  The amount of food necessary to survive the winter depends on the variety of bees and on the length and severity of local winters.

A wide range of species other than humans are attracted to wild or domestic sources of honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Animals that eat nectar and honey|author=Alice L.

===Preservation===

Because of its unique composition and chemical properties, honey is suitable for long-term storage, and is easily assimilated even after long preservation. Honey, and objects immersed in honey, have been preserved for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i0hNLjVL49oC&amp;pg=PA83 The History of the Origin and Development of Museums]&quot;. Dr. M. A. Hagen. The American naturalist, Volume 10. 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1894. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuYqAAAAYAAJ ''The Mummy: A Handbook of Egyptian Funerary Archaeology'']. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (Reprinted New York: Dover Publications, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The key to preservation is limiting access to humidity. In its cured state, honey has a sufficiently high sugar content to inhibit fermentation. If exposed to moist air, its [[hydrophilic]] properties pull moisture into the honey, eventually diluting it to the point that fermentation can begin.

The shelf life of honey is due to an enzyme found in the stomach of bees. [[Glucose oxidase]] is mixed by the bees with expelled nectar previously consumed by the bees which then creates &quot;two by-products: gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide&quot; which are responsible for honey's acidity and ability to suppress bacterial growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-science-behind-honeys-eternal-shelf-life-1218690/?no-ist|title=The Science Behind Honey’s Eternal Shelf Life|last=Geiling|first=Natasha|newspaper=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- repeat of above Regardless of preservation, honey may crystallize over time. The crystals can be dissolved by heating the honey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heavenlyhomemakers.com/what-to-do-about-crystallized-honey What to Do About Crystallized Honey]. Heavenly Homemakers.

=== Adulteration ===

Adulteration of honey is the addition of other sugars, syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the [[Codex Alimentarius]] of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-1119-5_8|title=Authenticity of honey|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-1119-5_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adulteration of honey is sometimes used as a method of deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hive: The Story of the Honeybee and Us'' By Bee Wilson --St. Martins Press 2004 Page 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isotope ratio mass spectrometry]] can be used to detect addition of [[corn syrup]] and [[Sugar cane|cane sugar]] by the carbon [[isotopic signature]]. Addition of sugars originating from corn or sugar cane ([[C4 carbon fixation|C4 plants]], unlike the plants used by bees, and also [[sugar beet]], which are predominantly [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 plants]]) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=C3, C4: Mechanisms, and Cellular and Environmental Regulation, of Photosynthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXqeDGfKDhIC&amp;pg=PA469|publisher=University of California Press|pages=469–|id=GGKEY:05LA62Q2TQJ|author1=Edwards, G  |author2=Walker, D A|year=1983|quote=Sucrose synthesized by a C3 plant (e.g. sugar beet) can be distinguished from sucrose synthesized by a C4 plant (e.g. sugarcane) due to differences in δ values.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins. In an unadulterated honey, the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match. Levels as low as 7% of addition can be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hivelights|volume=12|issue=1|year=1999|author=Barry, Carla |url=http://www.honeycouncil.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=4846|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617102807/http://www.honeycouncil.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=4846|archivedate=17 June 2008|title=The detection of C4 sugars in honey|publisher=Canadian Honey Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one country, the USA, according to the National Honey Board (a USDA-overseen organization), &quot;honey stipulates a pure product that does not allow for the addition of any other substance... this includes, but is not limited to, water or other [[Sugar substitute|sweeteners]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honey.com/images/downloads/honeydefs.pdf Definition of honey and honey products].

In 2014, 1.5 million [[tonne]]s of honey were produced worldwide, with [[China]] alone accounting for 31% of the world total (table).&lt;ref name=FAOstat14/&gt; The next four largest producers – [[Turkey]], [[United States]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]] – accounted collectively for 22% of the world total.&lt;ref name=FAOstat14/&gt;

==Modern uses==

===Food===

Over its history as a food,&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt; the main uses of honey are in [[cooking]], [[baking]], [[dessert]]s, such as ''[[mel i mató]]'', as a spread on [[bread]], as an addition to various beverages, such as [[tea]], and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages. Honey [[barbecue]] and [[honey mustard]] are other common flavors used in [[sauce]]s.

===Fermentation===

Possibly the world's oldest [[fermentation|fermented]] beverage dating to 3,000 years ago, [[mead]] (&quot;honey wine&quot;) is the alcoholic product made by adding [[yeast]] to the honey&amp;ndash;water [[must]], followed by weeks or months of fermentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;jib&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/jib.239|title=Improvement of mead fermentation by honey-must supplementation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jib.239/full|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing|volume=121|issue=3|pages=405|year=2015|last1=Pereira|first1=Ana Paula|last2=Mendes-Ferreira|first2=Ana|last3=Estevinho|first3=Leticia M.|last4=Mendes-Faia|first4=Arlete}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25153872|year=2014|author1=Iglesias|first1=A|title=Developments in the fermentation process and quality improvement strategies for mead production|journal=Molecules|volume=19|issue=8|pages=12577–90|last2=Pascoal|first2=A|last3=Choupina|first3=A.

==Physical and chemical properties==

[[File:Crystallized honey with close-up.jpg|thumb|Crystallized honey: The inset shows a close-up of the honey, showing the individual glucose grains in the fructose mixture.]]

The physical properties of honey vary, depending on water content, the type of flora used to produce it (pasturage), temperature, and the proportion of the specific sugars it contains. Fresh honey is a [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a [[supercooling|supercooled]] liquid, in which the [[glucose]] will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] glucose [[crystal]]s in a solution of [[fructose]] and other ingredients.

At the temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C, [[density]] of honey typically ranges between 1.38 and 1.45&amp;nbsp;kg/l.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomasik2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Tomasik|title=Chemical and Functional Properties of Food Saccharides|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RfVqdqxCiUC&amp;pg=PA74|date=20 October 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-49572-8|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase transitions===

The melting point of crystallized honey is between {{convert|40|and|50|C|F}}, depending on its composition. Below this temperature, honey can be either in a [[metastable]] state, meaning that it will not crystallize until a [[seed crystal]] is added, or, more often, it is in a &quot;labile&quot; state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Root|Root]], p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as [[brassica]] honey,  crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or [[tupelo]] honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others produce many small crystals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotr Tomasik p. 74&quot;&gt;Tomasik, Piotr (2004) ''Chemical and functional properties of food saccharides'', CRC Press, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-8493-1486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystallization is also affected by water content, because a high percentage of water inhibits crystallization, as does a high [[dextrin]] content. Temperature also affects the rate of crystallization, with the fastest growth occurring between {{convert|13|and|17|C|F}}. Crystal nuclei (seeds) tend to form more readily if the honey is disturbed, by stirring, shaking, or agitating, rather than if left at rest. However, the [[nucleation]] of microscopic seed-crystals is greatest between {{convert|5|and|8|C|F}}. Therefore, larger but fewer crystals tend to form at higher temperatures, while smaller but more-numerous crystals usually form at lower temperatures. Below 5&amp;nbsp;°C, the honey will not crystallize, thus the original texture and flavor can be preserved indefinitely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotr Tomasik p. 74&quot;/&gt;

Since honey normally exists below its melting point, it is a supercooled liquid. At very low temperatures, honey does not freeze solid. Instead, as the temperatures become lower, the viscosity of honey increases. Like most [[viscous liquid]]s, the honey  becomes thick and sluggish with decreasing temperature. At {{convert|-20|C|F}}, honey may appear or even feel solid, but it continues to flow at very low rates. Honey has a [[glass transition]] between {{convert|-42|and|-51|C|F}}. Below this temperature, honey enters a [[glass]]y state and  becomes an [[amorphous solid]] (noncrystalline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Kántor Z, Pitsi G, Thoen J | title = Glass Transition Temperature of Honey as a Function of Water Content As Determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 2327–2330 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10794630 | doi = 10.1021/jf981070g }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Russell EV, Israeloff NE | title = Direct observation of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6813 | pages = 695–698 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11130066 | doi = 10.1038/35047037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viscosity===
[[File:Honey-miel.jpg|thumb|right|Pouring raw honey. The sheet-like appearance of the flow is the result of high viscosity and low surface tension, contributing to the stickiness of honey.]]

The [[viscosity]] of honey is affected greatly by both temperature and water content. The higher the water percentage, the more easily honey [[Fluid dynamics|flows]]. Above its melting point, however, water has little effect on viscosity. Aside from water content, the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity, with the exception of a few types. At {{convert|25|C|F}}, honey with 14% water content generally has a viscosity around 400 [[poise]], while a honey containing 20% water has a viscosity around 20 poise. Viscosity increase due to temperature occurs very slowly at first. A honey containing 16% water, at {{convert|70|C|F}}, has a viscosity around 2 poise, while at {{convert|30|C|F}}, the viscosity is around 70 poise. As cooling progresses, honey becomes more viscous at an increasingly rapid rate, reaching 600 poise around {{convert|14|C|F}}. However, while honey is very viscous, it has rather low [[surface tension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Value-added products from beekeeping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzzBBbnIJhIC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1996|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-103819-2|pages=7–8|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bee-hexagon.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Bogdanov, Stefan | date=2009 | url=http://www.bee-hexagon.net/files/file/fileE/Honey/4PhysicalPropertiesHoney.pdf | title=Physical Properties of Honey | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920094501/http://www.bee-hexagon.net/files/file/fileE/Honey/4PhysicalPropertiesHoney.pdf | archive-date=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few types of honey have unusual viscous properties. Honeys from [[Calluna vulgaris|heather]] or [[Leptospermum scoparium|manuka]] display [[thixotropic]] properties. These types of honey enter a gel-like state when motionless, but then liquify when stirred.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Krell|Krell]], pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical and optical properties===

Because honey contains [[electrolyte]]s, in the form of acids and minerals, it exhibits varying degrees of [[electrical conductivity]]. Measurements of the electrical conductivity are used to determine the quality of honey in terms of ash content.&lt;ref name=&quot;bee-hexagon.net&quot;/&gt;

The effect honey has on light is useful for determining the type and quality. Variations in the water content alter the [[refractive index]] of honey. Water content can easily be measured with a [[refractometer]]. Typically, the refractive index for honey ranges from 1.504 at 13% water content to 1.474 at 25%. Honey also has an effect on [[polarized light]], in that it rotates the polarization plane. The fructose gives a negative rotation, while the glucose gives a positive one. The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture.&lt;ref name=&quot;bee-hexagon.net&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bee Culture' Page 348&quot;&gt;[[#Root|Root]], p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Honey may vary in color between pale yellow and dark brown, but other bright colors may occasionally be found, depending on the source of the sugar harvested by the bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9587260/Bees-producing-MandMs-coloured-honey.html|title=Bees 'producing M&amp;M's coloured honey'|date=4 October 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygroscopy and fermentation===

Honey has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air, a phenomenon called [[hygroscopy]]. The amount of water the honey absorbs is dependent on the relative humidity of the air. Because honey contains yeast, this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent fermentation, which usually begins if the honey's water content rises much above 25%. Honey tends to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bee Culture' Page 348&quot;/&gt;

Fermentation of honey usually occurs after crystallization, because without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth. Honey that is to be stored at room temperature for long periods of time is often [[pasteurized]], to kill any yeast, by heating it above {{convert|70|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bee Culture' Page 348&quot;/&gt;

===Thermal characteristics===
[[File:Creamed honey Maillard reaction after aging.jpg|thumb|Creamed honey. On the left is how it appears fresh, but the honey on the right has been aged at room temperature for two years. While still edible, the Maillard reaction produces considerable differences in the color and flavor of the aged honey.]]

Like all sugar compounds, honey [[caramelization|caramelize]]s if heated sufficiently, becoming darker in color, and eventually burns. However, honey contains fructose, which caramelizes at lower temperatures than glucose.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Dieter Belitz, Werner Grosch, Peter Schieberle [https://books.google.com/books?id=xteiARU46SQC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Food chemistry''] Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg 2004 p. 884 {{ISBN|3-540-69933-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature at which caramelization begins varies, depending on the composition, but is typically between {{convert|70|and|110|C|F}}. Honey also contains acids, which act as [[catalyst]]s for caramelization. The specific types of acids and their amounts play a primary role in determining the exact temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Zdzisław E. Sikorski ''Chemical and functional properties of food components'' CRC Press 2007 p. 121 {{ISBN|0-8493-9675-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these acids, the amino acids, which occur in very small amounts, play an important role in the darkening of honey. The amino acids form darkened compounds called [[melanoidin]]s, during a [[Maillard reaction]]. The Maillard reaction occurs slowly at room temperature, taking from a few to several months to show visible darkening, but speeds up dramatically with increasing temperatures. However, the reaction can also be slowed by storing the honey at colder temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Root|Root]], p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other liquids, honey has very poor [[thermal conductivity]], taking a long time to reach [[thermal equilibrium]]. Melting crystallized honey can easily result in localized caramelization if the heat source is too hot, or if it is not evenly distributed. However, honey takes substantially longer to liquify when just above the melting point than at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;bee-hexagon.net&quot;/&gt; Melting 20&amp;nbsp;kg of crystallized honey, at {{convert|40|C|F}}, can take up to 24 hours, while 50&amp;nbsp;kg may take twice as long. These times can be cut nearly in half by heating at {{convert|50|C|F}}. However, many of the minor substances in honey can be affected greatly by heating, changing the flavor, aroma, or other properties, so heating is usually done at the lowest temperature possible for the shortest amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Krell|Krell]], pp. 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acid content and flavor effects===

However, the different types and their amounts vary considerably, depending on the type of honey.

Honey is classified by its floral source, and divisions are made according to the packaging and processing used. Also, [[regional honeys]] are identified. In the USA, honey is also graded on its color and optical density by [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] standards, graded on the Pfund scale, which ranges from 0 for &quot;water white&quot; honey to more than 114 for &quot;dark amber&quot; honey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/w0076E/w0076e04.htm Value-added products from beekeeping.

===Floral source===

Generally, honey is classified by the floral source of the nectar from which it was made. Honeys can be from specific types of flower nectars or can be blended after collection. The pollen in honey is traceable to floral source and therefore region of origin. The [[Rheology|rheological]] and [[Melissopalynology|melissopalynological]] properties of honey can be used to identify the major plant nectar source used in its production.&lt;ref name=&quot;honeyRheo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minervascientific.co.uk/bulletins/Rheological_Properties_of_Honey.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Rheological &amp; Mellisopalynological Properties of Honey |publisher=Minerva Scientific|accessdate=10 December 2012|quote=&quot;If however, rheological measurements are made on a given sample it can be deduced that the sample is predominantly Manuka (Graph 2) or Kanuka (Graph 3) or a mixture of the two plant species&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blended====

Most commercially available honey is blended,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OWwCXEZJ-u8C&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=Most+commercially+available+honey+is+blended#v=onepage&amp;q=Most%20commercially%20available%20honey%20is%20blended&amp;f=false|title=Homebrewing For Dummies|last=Nachel|first=Marty|date=2008-06-23|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470374160|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it is a mixture of two or more honeys differing in floral source, color, flavor, density, or geographic origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;honeydefs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honey.com/images/downloads/honeydefs.pdf|format=PDF|title=Definition of Honey and Honey Products|publisher=National Honey Issac Board|accessdate=3 February 2011|quote=&quot;Blended Honey: A homogeneous mixture of two or more honeys differing in floral source, color, flavor, density or geographic origin.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polyfloral====

Polyfloral honey, also known as wildflower honey,&lt;ref name=&quot;Honey Floral Source Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honey.com/newsroom/press-kits/honey-color-and-flavor|title=Honey Color and Flavor|publisher=National Honey Board|accessdate=3 February 2011|quote=Wildflower honey is often used to describe honey from miscellaneous and undefined flower sources.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the nectar of many types of flowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;honeybook_polyfloral&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honeybook.net/polyfloral_honey.shtml|title=Varieties of honey: Polyfloral honey|publisher=The Honey Book|accessdate=10 November 2007|quote=Honey that is from wild or commercialized honeybees that is derived from many types of flowers is a resulting Polyfloral honey.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The taste may vary from year to year, and the aroma and the flavor can be more or less intense, depending on which bloomings are prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mieliditalia.it/colori/inglese/m20/m20.htm Mountain Wildflower Honey]. Mieliditalia.it. Retrieved on 6 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monofloral====

[[Monofloral honey]] is made primarily from the nectar of one type of flower. Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal [[nectar source]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;mieliditalia1&quot;&gt;[http://www.mieliditalia.it/colori/inglese/home.htm The Colours Of Honey]. Mieliditalia.it. Retrieved on 6 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; To produce monofloral honey, beekeepers keep beehives in an area where the bees have access to only one type of flower. In practice, because of the difficulties in containing bees, a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 21st Century Homestead: Beekeeping|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGDxCQAAQBAJ|publisher = Lulu.com|date = 21 February 2015|isbn = 9781312937338|language = en|first = Brant|last = Reuber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are [[clover]], [[orange blossom]], [[blueberry]], sage, [[tupelo]], [[buckwheat]], [[fireweed]], [[mesquite]], and [[sourwood]]. Some typical European examples include [[thyme]], [[thistle]], [[Ericaceae|heather]], [[acacia]], [[dandelion]], [[sunflower]], [[lavender]], [[honeysuckle]], and varieties from [[Tilia|lime]] and [[chestnut]] trees.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In [[North Africa]] (e.g. [[Egypt]]), examples include clover, [[cotton]], and [[citrus]] (mainly orange blossoms).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The unique flora of [[Australia]] yields a number of distinctive honeys, with some of the most popular being [[yellow box]], [[blue gum]], [[ironbark]], bush [[List of Eucalyptus species|mallee]], Tasmanian [[Eucryphia lucida|leatherwood]], and [[macadamia]].

===Honeydew honey===

Instead of taking nectar, bees can take [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], the sweet secretions of [[aphid]]s or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, with a rich fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as sweet as nectar honeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;mieliditalia1&quot;/&gt; [[Germany]]'s [[Black Forest]] is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, as well as some regions in Bulgaria, [[Tara (mountain)]] in [[Serbia]], and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, [[pine honey]] (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gounari|first=Sofia|title=Studies on the phenology of Marchalina hellenica (gen.)

The production of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers. This honey has a much larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys, thus causing [[Diseases of the honey bee#Dysentery|dysentery]] to the bees{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, resulting in the death of colonies in areas with cold winters. Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas. Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements, as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.

===Classification by packaging and processing===

Generally, honey is bottled in its familiar liquid form. However, honey is sold in other forms, and can be subjected to a variety of processing methods.

* '''Crystallized honey''' occurs when some of the glucose content has spontaneously crystallized from solution as the monohydrate. It is also called &quot;granulated honey&quot; or &quot;candied honey&quot;.

===Grading===
{{See also|Food grading}}

In the US, honey grading is performed voluntarily (USDA does offer inspection and grading &quot;as on-line (in-plant) or lot inspection...upon application, on a fee-for-service basis.&quot;) based upon USDA standards. Honey is graded based upon a number of factors, including water content, flavor and aroma, absence of defects, and clarity. Honey is also classified by color, though it is not a factor in the grading scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Extracted_Honey_Standard%5B1%5D.pdf|title=United States Standards for Grades of Extracted Honey|publisher=USDA|accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries may have differing standards on the grading of honey. [[India]], for example, certifies honey grades based on additional factors, such as the Fiehe's test, and other empirical measurements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agmarknet.nic.in/honeygmr.pdf NOTIFICATION], MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE (Department of Agriculture and Co-operation) New Delhi, 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators of quality===

High-quality honey can be distinguished by fragrance, taste, and consistency. Ripe, freshly collected, high-quality honey at {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} should flow from a knife in a straight stream, without breaking into separate drops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honey production&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Bogdanov, Stefan | date=2008 | url=http://www.bee-hexagon.net/files/file/fileE/Honey/Honey%20ProductionCorr.pdf | title=Honey production | work=Bee Product Science | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305184128/http://www.bee-hexagon.net/files/file/fileE/Honey/Honey%20ProductionCorr.pdf | archivedate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After falling down, the honey should form a bead. The honey, when poured, should form small, temporary layers that disappear fairly quickly, indicating high viscosity. If not, it indicates excessive water content (over 20%)&lt;ref name=&quot;Honey production&quot;/&gt;
of the product. Honey with excessive water content is not suitable for long-term preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Allan, Matthew | url=http://www.beedata.com/data2/basic_honey_processing.htm | title=Basic Honey Processing | journal=Beekeeping in a Nutshell | volume=5 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217104623/http://www.beedata.com/data2/basic_honey_processing.htm | archive-date=17 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In jars, fresh honey should appear as a pure, consistent fluid, and should not set in layers. Within a few weeks to a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of {{convert|40|–|49|C|F}} to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, [[diastase]] activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the [[Phadebas]] methods. A fluffy film on the surface of the honey (like a white foam), or marble-colored or white-spotted crystallization on a container's sides, is formed by air bubbles trapped during the bottling process.

A 2008 Italian study determined [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] can be used to distinguish between different honey types, and can be used to pinpoint the area where it was produced. Researchers were able to identify differences in acacia and polyfloral honeys by the differing proportions of [[fructose]] and [[sucrose]], as well as differing levels of aromatic [[amino acid]]s [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. This ability allows greater ease of selecting compatible stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cen-v086n035.p043|journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|year=2008|volume=86|title=Keeping Tabs on Honey|pages=43–44|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 1980 study found that mixed [[flower|floral]] honey from several United States regions typically contains:&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beesource.com/resources/usda/honey-composition-and-properties|title=Beesource Beekeeping: Honey Composition and Properties|publisher=Beesource.com|date=October 1980|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fructose: 38.2%
* Glucose: 31.3%

* Water: 17.2%
* [[Maltodextrin|Higher sugars]]: 1.5%

A 2013 [[NMR spectroscopy]] study of 20 different honeys from Germany found that their sugar contents comprised:
* Fructose: 28% to 41%
* Glucose: 22% to 35%
The average ratio was 56% fructose to 44% glucose, but the ratios in the individual honeys ranged from a high of 64% fructose and 36% glucose (one type of flower honey; table 3 in reference) to a low of 50% fructose and 50% glucose (a different floral source). This NMR method was not able to quantify maltose, [[galactose]], and the other minor sugars as compared to fructose and glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Qualitative and Quantitative Control of Honeys Using NMR Spectroscopy and Chemometrics|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/825318|journal = ISRN Analytical Chemistry|date = 12 May 2013|pages = 1–9|volume = 2013|doi = 10.1155/2013/825318|language = en|first = Marc|last = Ohmenhaeuser|first2 = Yulia B.|last2 = Monakhova|first3 = Thomas|last3 = Kuballa|first4 = Dirk W.|last4 = Lachenmeier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===

==== Wounds and burns ====

Honey contains trace amount of compounds implicated in preliminary studies to have wound-healing properties, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effect of dilution on the rate of hydrogen peroxide production in honey and its implications for wound healing|journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|date = 1 April 2003|pmid = 12804080|pages = 267–273|volume = 9|issue = 2|doi = 10.1089/10755530360623383|first = Lynne M.|last = Bang|first2 = Catherine|last2 = Buntting|first3 = Peter|last3 = Molan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[methylglyoxal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Methylglyoxal-induced modifications of significant honeybee proteinous components in manuka honey: Possible therapeutic implications|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367326X12000512|journal = Fitoterapia|date = 1 June 2012|pages = 671–677|volume = 83|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.fitote.2012.02.002|first = Juraj|last = Majtan|first2 = Jaroslav|last2 = Klaudiny|first3 = Jana|last3 = Bohova|first4 = Lenka|last4 = Kohutova|first5 = Maria|last5 = Dzurova|first6 = Maria|last6 = Sediva|first7 = Maria|last7 = Bartosova|first8 = Viktor|last8 = Majtan|pmid=22366273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence shows that honey may help healing in skin wounds after surgery and mild (partial thickness) burns when used in a dressing, but in general, the evidence for the use of honey in wound treatment is of such low quality that firm conclusions cannot be drawn.&lt;ref name=Jull2015&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005083.pub4/abstract |title=Honey as a topical treatment for wounds |last=Jull |first=Andrew B. |last2=Cullum |first2=Nicky |last3=Dumville |first3=Jo C. |last4=Westby |first4=Maggie J. |last5=Deshpande |first5=Sohan |last6=Walker |first6=Natalie |year=2015 |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=3 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |pmid=25742878 |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd005083.pub4 |quote=Honey appears to heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional treatment (which included polyurethane film, paraffin gauze, soframycin-impregnated gauze, sterile linen and leaving the burns exposed) and infected post-operative wounds more quickly than antiseptics and gauze.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majtan |first1=J |title=Honey: an immunomodulator in wound healing |journal=Wound Repair Regen. |date=2014 |volume=22 |issue=2 Mar–Apr |pages=187–192 |doi=10.1111/wrr.12117 |pmid=24612472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health hazards===

Although honey is generally safe when taken in typical food amounts,&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldman2014/&gt; there are various, potential [[adverse effect]]s or [[interaction]]s it may have in combination with excessive consumption, existing [[disease]] conditions or [[drug]]s.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt; Included among these are mild reactions to high intake, such as [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[insomnia]], or [[hyperactivity]] in about 10% of children, according to one study.&lt;ref name=Goldman2014/&gt; No symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, or hyperactivity were detected with honey consumption compared to [[placebo]], according to another study.&lt;ref name=Goldman2014/&gt; Honey consumption may interact adversely with existing [[allergy|allergies]], high [[blood sugar]] levels (as in [[diabetes]]), or [[anticoagulant]]s used to control [[bleeding]], among other [[clinical medicine|clinical]] conditions.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

People who have a [[immunocompromised|weakened immune system]] may be at risk of bacterial or fungal infection from eating honey,&lt;ref name=safety&gt;{{cite book|editors=Prakash V, Martin-Belloso O, Keener L, Astley SB, Braun S, McMahon H, Lelieveld H|work=Regulating Safety of Traditional and Ethnic Foods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2glBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223|year=2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-800620-7|page=223|title=Safety of Honey|author=Grigoryan K}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no high-quality clinical evidence that this occurs commonly.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

====Botulism====

Infants can develop [[botulism]] after consuming honey contaminated with ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' endospores.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHB botulism&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.honey.com/nhb/about-honey/frequently-asked-questions/category/honey-properties/ | title=The National Honey Board: Frequently Asked Questions | work=Honey.com | accessdate=6 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201094727/http://www.honey.com/nhb/about-honey/frequently-asked-questions/category/honey-properties/ | archive-date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infantile botulism shows geographical variation.

====Toxic honey====
{{main article|Bees and toxic chemicals#Toxic honey}}

Mad honey intoxication is a result of eating honey containing [[grayanotoxin]]s.&lt;ref name=JansenKleerekooper2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jansen|first1=Suze A.|last2=Kleerekooper|first2=Iris|last3=Hofman|first3=Zonne L.

Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, nausea, and vomiting. Less commonly, low blood pressure, shock, heart rhythm irregularities, and convulsions may occur, with rare cases resulting in death. Honey intoxication is more likely when using &quot;natural&quot; unprocessed honey and honey from farmers who may have a small number of hives. Commercial processing, with pooling of honey from numerous sources, is thought to dilute any toxins.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot;&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314133504/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071128.htm |date=14 March 2010 |title=&quot;Grayanotoxin&quot; }}[https://web.archive.org/web/20130308010321/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071128.htm] in the ''Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook'', FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxic honey may also result when bees are proximate to [[tutu (plant)|tutu]] bushes (''Coriaria arborea'') and the vine hopper insect (''[[Scolypopa australis]]''). Both are found throughout New Zealand. Bees gather honeydew produced by the vine hopper insects feeding on the tutu plant. This introduces the poison [[Tutin (toxin)|tutin]] into honey.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA&quot;&gt;{{citation | url=http://nba.org.nz/uploads/starting-with-bees-tutin-section.pdf | title=Tutu Bush and Toxic Honey | work=National Beekeepers Association, New Zealand | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005173024/http://nba.org.nz/uploads/starting-with-bees-tutin-section.pdf |archive-date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few areas in New Zealand (the [[Coromandel Peninsula]], Eastern [[Bay of Plenty]] and the [[Marlborough Sounds]]) frequently produce toxic honey. Symptoms of tutin poisoning include vomiting, delirium, giddiness, increased excitability, stupor, coma, and violent convulsions.{{mcn|date=April 2015}} To reduce the risk of tutin poisoning, humans should not eat honey taken from feral hives in the risk areas of New Zealand. Since December 2001, New Zealand beekeepers have been required to reduce the risk of producing toxic honey by closely monitoring tutu, vine hopper, and foraging conditions within {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} of their apiary. {{citation needed|reason=needed for section in general|date=April 2015}} Intoxication is rarely dangerous.&lt;ref name=JansenKleerekooper2012/&gt;

==History and culture==

Honey use and production has a long and varied history.&lt;ref name=hunt /&gt; In many cultures, honey has associations that go beyond its use as a food. It is frequently used as a [[amulet|talisman]] and [[symbol]] of sweetness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HGDxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=In+many+cultures,+honey+has+associations+that+go+beyond+its+use+as+a+food.+It+is+frequently+used+as+a+talisman+and+symbol+of+sweetness#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20many%20cultures,%20honey%20has%20associations%20that%20go%20beyond%20its%20use%20as%20a%20food.%20It%20is%20frequently%20used%20as%20a%20talisman%20and%20symbol%20of%20sweetness&amp;f=false|title=21st Century Homestead: Beekeeping|last=Reuber|first=Brant|date=2015-02-21|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781312937338|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 594 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny|title=XI.9.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; beekeeping around [[Athens]] was so widespread that [[Solon]] passed a law about it: &quot;He who sets up hives of bees must put them {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=off}} away from those already installed by another&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plutarch|title=Life of Solon|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;crane book&quot; /&gt; Greek archaeological excavations of pottery located ancient hives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Princeton University Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bresson|first1=Alain|title=The Making of the Ancient Greek Economy: Institutions, Markets and Growth|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wU9FCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=honey+ancient+greek#v=onepage&amp;q=honey%20ancient%20greek&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 December 2015|isbn=9781400852451|date=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Columella]], Greek beekeepers of the Hellenistic period did not hesitate to move their hives over rather long distances to maximise production, taking advantage of the different vegetative cycles in different regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Princeton University Press&quot;/&gt;

In the absence of sugar, honey was an integral sweetening ingredient in Greek and Roman cuisine. During Roman times, honey was part of many recipes and it is mentioned in the work of many authors, such as [[Virgil]], [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], [[Cicero]], and others.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The spiritual and therapeutic use of honey in [[India|ancient India]] is documented in both the [[Vedas]] and the [[Ayurveda]] texts, which were both composed at least 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pećanac-&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Pećanac M, Janjić Z, Komarcević A, Pajić M, Dobanovacki D, Misković SS | title = Burns treatment in ancient times | journal = Med Pregl | volume = 66 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 263–7 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/s0264-410x(02)00603-5 | pmid = 23888738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beekeeping in [[ancient China]] has existed since ancient times and appears to be untraceable to its origin. In the book ''Golden Rules of Business Success'' written by [[Fan Li]] (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], some parts mention the art of beekeeping and the importance of the quality of the wooden box for beekeeping that can affect the quality of its honey.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Honey was also cultivated in ancient [[Mesoamerica]]. The [[Maya peoples|Maya]] used honey from the [[stingless bee]] for culinary purposes, and continue to do so today. The Maya also regard the bee as sacred (see [[Stingless bee#Mayan stingless bees of Central America|Mayan stingless bees of Central America]]).

Some cultures believed honey had many practical health uses. It was used as an ointment for rashes and burns, and to help soothe sore throats when no other practices were available.

===Folk medicine and wound research===

In [[myth]]s and [[folk medicine]], honey has been used both orally and topically to treat various ailments including [[gastric]] disturbances, [[ulcer]]s, [[skin]] [[wound]]s, and [[skin burn]]s by ancient Greeks and Egyptians, and in [[Ayurveda]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pećanac-&quot; /&gt;

Proposed for treating wounds and burns, honey may have [[antimicrobial]] properties as first reported in 1892 and be useful as a safe, [[improvisation]]al wound treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;future&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maddocks |first1=Sarah E |last2=Jenkins |first2=Rowena E |title=Honey: a sweet solution to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance? |journal=Future Microbiology |year=2013 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1419–1429 |doi=10.2217/fmb.13.105 |pmid=24199801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=JA |last2=McGrane |first2=OL |last3=Wedmore |first3=IS |title=Wound care in the wilderness: is there evidence for honey? |journal=Wilderness Environ Med. |year=2014 |volume=25 |issue=1 (Mar)|pages=103–110 |doi=10.1016/j.wem.2013.08.006 |pmid=24393701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its supposed antimicrobial properties may be due to high [[osmolarity]] even when diluted with water, it is more effective than plain sugar water of a similar viscosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;future&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot; /&gt; Definitive clinical conclusions about the efficacy and safety of treating wounds, however, are not possible from this limited research.&lt;ref name=Jull2015/&gt;

The [[flora]] that bees use to make the honey may have a role in its properties, particularly by bees foraging from the manuka myrtle,  ''[[Leptospermum scoparium]]'', as proposed in one study.&lt;ref name=&quot;future&quot; /&gt;

===Religious significance===

'''Ancient Greeks Religion'''
In [[ancient Greek religion]], the food of [[Zeus]] and the 12 [[Twelve Olympians|Gods of Olympus]] was honey in the form of nectar and [[ambrosia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kNeTxae8vV4C|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 1 April 1980|isbn = 9780674379305|language = en|first = Albert|last = Henrichs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism''' 
In [[Hinduism]], honey (''[[Madhu]]'') is one of the five elixirs of immortality (''[[Panchamrita]]''). In temples, honey is poured over the deities in a ritual called ''Madhu [[abhisheka]]''. The ''Vedas'' and other ancient literature mention the use of honey as a great medicinal and health food.&lt;ref name=&quot;fjnet.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.fjnet.com/english/society/t20061117_41041.htm A Meaningful Story of Buddha, Elephant and Monkey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319080236/http://www.fjnet.com/english/society/t20061117_41041.htm |date=19 March 2008 }} by Marguerite Theophil, United Press International, 16 November 2006, accessed 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaism''' 
In Jewish tradition, honey is a symbol for the new year, ''[[Rosh Hashanah]]''. At the traditional meal for that holiday, apple slices are dipped in honey and eaten to bring a sweet new year. Some ''Rosh Hashanah'' greetings show honey and an apple, symbolizing the feast. In some congregations, small straws of honey are given out to usher in the new year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CD8U0PXesiMC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=rosh%20hashanah%20%22honey%20straws%22&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q=straws&amp;f=false|title=Napa Valley's Jewish Heritage|last=Michalski|first=Henry|last2=Mendelsohn|first2=Donna|last3=Valley|first3=Jewish Historical Society of Napa|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738588988|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains many references to honey. In the [[Book of Judges]], Samson found a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of a lion (14:8). In Old Testament law, offerings were made in the temple to God. The [[Book of Leviticus]] says that &quot;Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord&quot; (2:11). In the [[Books of Samuel]], [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]] is forced into a confrontation with his father [[King Saul]] after eating honey in violation of a rash oath Saul has made ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:24–47|NKJV}}). Proverbs 16:24 in the JPS Tanakh 1917 version says &quot;Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.&quot; [[Book of Exodus]] famously describes the [[Promised Land]] as a &quot;land flowing with [[milk]] and honey&quot; (33:3). However, most Biblical commentators write that the original Hebrew in the Bible (דבש ''devash'') refers to the sweet syrup produced from the juice of [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] (''silan'').&lt;ref&gt;Berel, Rabbi.

Retrieved 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhism''' 
In Buddhism, honey plays an important role in the festival of ''[[Madhu Purnima]]'', celebrated in India and [[Bangladesh]]. The day commemorates [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s making peace among his disciples by retreating into the wilderness. The legend has it that while he was there, a [[Old World monkey|monkey]] brought him honey to eat. On ''Madhu Purnima'', Buddhists remember this act by giving honey to [[Buddhist monasticism|monks]]. The monkey's gift is frequently depicted in [[Buddhist art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fjnet.com&quot;/&gt;

'''Christianity''' 
In the Christian [[New Testament]], [[Matthew 3:4]], [[John the Baptist]] is said to have lived for a long period of time in the wilderness on a diet consisting of locusts and wild honey.

'''Islam'''
In Islam,  an entire chapter ([[Sura]]h) in the [[Qur'an]] is called ''[[an-Nahl]]'' (the Bees). According to his teachings (''[[hadith]]''), [[Muhammad]] strongly recommended [[Prophetic medicine|honey for healing purposes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari vol. 7, book 71, number 584, 585, 588 and 603.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an promotes honey as a nutritious and healthy food. Below is the English translation of those specific verses:
{{bquote|And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations; Then to eat of all the produce (of the earth), and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought [Al-Quran 16:68–69].&lt;ref name=&quot;'Abdullah Yusuf 'Ali&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first='Abdullah |last=Yusuf 'Ali |title=An Nahl, Al-Quran Chapter 16 (The Bee) quoted from &quot;The Holy Qur'an: Original Arabic Text with English Translation &amp; Selected Commentaries&quot; |url=http://muslimaccess.com/quraan/translations/yusufali/016.htm |accessdate=20 May 2013 |publisher=Saba Islamic Media |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226013840/http://muslimaccess.com/quraan/translations/yusufali/016.htm |archivedate=26 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Hengist and Horsa.jpg|thumb|350px|The brothers in [[Edward Parrott]]'s ''Pageant of British History'' (1909)]]
'''Hengist''' and '''Horsa''' are [[legend|legendary]] brothers said to have led the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] in their invasion of Britain in the 5th century. Tradition lists Hengist as the first of the Jutish kings of [[Kent]].

According to early sources, Hengist and Horsa arrived in Britain at [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet|Ebbsfleet]] on the [[Isle of Thanet]]. For a time, they served as mercenaries for [[Vortigern]], [[King of the Britons]], but later they turned against him (British accounts have them betraying him in the [[Treachery of the Long Knives|Night of the Long Knives]]). Horsa was killed fighting the Britons, but Hengist successfully conquered Kent, becoming the forefather of its kings.

A figure named Hengest, who may be identifiable with the leader of British legend, appears in the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'' and in ''[[Beowulf]]''. 

Legends of horse-associated founding brothers are attested among other [[Germanic peoples]] and appear in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures. As a result, scholars have theorized a [[Germanic mythology|pan-Germanic mythological]] origin for Hengist and Horsa, stemming originally from [[divine twins]] found in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. Other scholars, including [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], have argued for a historical basis for Hengist and Horsa.

==Etymology==
The [[Old English]] names ''Hengest'' {{IPA-ang|hendʒest|}} and ''Horsa'' {{IPA-ang|horsɑ|}} mean &quot;stallion&quot; and &quot;horse&quot; respectively.&lt;ref name=MALLORY135&gt;Mallory (2005:135).&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Old English word for a horse was ''[[Ehwaz|eoh]]''. ''Eoh'' derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base ''*ekwo'', hence [[Latin]] ''equus'' which gave rise to the modern English words ''equine'' and ''equestrian''. ''Hors'' is derived from the Proto-Indo-European base ''*kurs'', to run, which also gave rise to ''hurry, carry'' and ''current'' (the last two as borrowings from [[French language|French]]). ''Hors'' eventually replaced ''eoh'', fitting a pattern elsewhere in Germanic languages where the original names of sacred animals are abandoned in favour of adjectives; for example, the word ''[[Bear#Etymology|bear]]''. While the ''Ecclesiastical History'' and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' refer to the brother as ''Horsa'', in the ''History of the Britons'' his name is simply ''Hors''. It has been suggested that ''Horsa'' may be a pet form of a compound name with the first element &quot;horse&quot;.&lt;ref name=TOLKEIN173&gt;Tolkien (2006:173).&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it has also been suggested that these may have been given names or status titles within their tribe.  It is possible that the tribe had horses as a totem animal, perhaps even sailing with ships emblazoned with horse figureheads. By tradition the brothers arrived with a banner of a white horse, which is preserved to this day as the emblem of Kent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bates2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bates|first=Brian|title=The Real Middle Earth: Exploring the Magic and Mystery of the Middle Ages, J.R.R. Tolkien, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WVAnBgAAQBAJ&amp;rdid=book|year=2015:23|publisher=St. Martin's Press|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==

===''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''===
In his 8th century ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Bede]] records that the first chieftains among the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes in England were said to have been Hengist and Horsa. He relates that Horsa was killed in battle against the Britons and was thereafter buried in East Kent, where at the time of writing a monument still stood to him. According to Bede, Hengist and Horsa were the sons of [[Wictgils]], son of [[Witta, son of Wecta|Witta]], son of [[Wecta]], son of [[Woden]].&lt;ref name=SHERLEY-PRICE63&gt;Shirley-Price (1990:63).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===
The 9th century ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records that in the year 449 Hengist and Horsa were invited to Britain by Vortigern to assist his forces in fighting the [[Picts]]. They landed at Eopwinesfleot (Ebbsfleet), and went on to defeat the Picts wherever they fought them. Hengist and Horsa sent word home to Germany describing &quot;the worthlessness of the Britons, and the richness of the land&quot; and asked for assistance. Their request was granted and support arrived. Afterward, more people arrived in Britain from &quot;the three powers of Germany; the Old Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes&quot;. The Saxons populated [[Essex]], [[Sussex]], and [[Wessex]]; the Jutes Kent, the [[Isle of Wight]], and part of [[Hampshire]]; and the Angles [[East Anglia]], [[Mercia]], and [[Northumbria]] (leaving their original homeland, [[Angeln]], deserted). These forces were led by the brothers Hengist and Horsa, sons of Wihtgils, son of Witta, son of Wecta, son of Woden.&lt;ref name=INGRAM13-14&gt;Ingram (1823:13-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the entry for the year 455 the ''Chronicle'' details that Hengist and Horsa fought with Vortigern at [[Battle of Aylesford|Aylesford]] and that Horsa died there. Hengist took control of the kingdom with his son [[Oisc of Kent|Esc]]. In 457, Hengist and Esc fought against British forces in [[Crayford]] &quot;and there slew four thousand men&quot;. The Britons left the land of Kent and fled to London. In 465, Hengest and Esc fought again at the [[Battle of Wippedesfleot]], probably near Ebbsfleet, and slew twelve British leaders. In the year 473, the final entry in the ''Chronicle'' mentioning Hengist or Horsa, Hengist and Esc are recorded as having taken &quot;immense booty&quot; and the Britons having &quot;fled from the English like fire&quot;.&lt;ref name=INGRAM15-16&gt;Ingram (1823:15-16).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''History of the Britons''===
[[File:Hengest and Horsa Verstegan.jpg|thumb|Hengist and Horsa arriving in Britain, by [[Richard Rowlands]] (1605)]]
The 9th century ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]'', attributed to the Briton [[Nennius]], records that, during the reign of Vortigern in Britain, three vessels that had been exiled from Germany arrived in Britain, commanded by Hengist and Horsa. The narrative then gives a genealogy of the two: Hengist and Horsa were sons of Guictglis, son of Guicta, son of Guechta, son of Vouden, son of Frealof, son of Fredulf, son of Finn, son of Foleguald, son of Geta. Geta was said to be the son of a god, yet &quot;not of the omnipotent God and our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; but rather &quot;the offspring of one of their idols, and whom, blinded by some demon, they worshipped according to the custom of the heathen.&quot; In 447 AD, Vortigern received Hengist and Horsa &quot;as friends&quot; and gave to the brothers the Isle of Thanet.&lt;ref name=GUNN18&gt;Gunn (1819:18).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Saxons had lived on Thanet for &quot;some time&quot; Vortigern promised them supplies of clothing and other provisions on condition that they assist him in fighting the enemies of his country. As the Saxons increased in number the Britons became unable to keep their agreement, and so told them their assistance was no longer needed and they should go home.&lt;ref name=GUNN22&gt;Gunn (1819:22).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern allowed Hengist to send for more of his countrymen to come over to fight for him. Messengers were sent to &quot;[[Scythia]]&quot;, where &quot;a number&quot; of warriors were selected, and, with sixteen ships, the messengers returned. With the men came Hengist's beautiful daughter. Hengist prepared a feast, inviting Vortigern, Vortigern's officers, and Ceretic, his translator. Prior to the feast, Hengist enjoined his daughter to serve the guests plenty of wine and ale so that they would become drunk. At the feast Vortigern became enamored with her and promised Hengist whatever he liked in exchange for her betrothal. Hengist, having &quot;consulted with the Elders who attended him of the Angle race,&quot; demanded Kent. Without the knowledge of the then-ruler of Kent, Vortigern agreed.&lt;ref name=GUNN22-23&gt;Gunn (1819:22–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hengist's daughter was given to Vortigern, who slept with her and deeply loved her. Hengist told him that he would now be both his father and adviser and that he would know no defeat with his counsel, &quot;for the people of my country are strong, warlike, and robust.&quot; With Vortigern's approval, Hengist would send for his son and his brother to fight against the Scots and those who dwelt near the wall. Vortigern agreed and [[Octa of Kent|Ochta]] and Ebissa arrived with 40 ships, sailed around the land of the Picts, conquered &quot;many regions,&quot; and assaulted the Orkney Islands. Hengist continued to send for more ships from his country, so that some islands where his people had previously dwelt are now free of inhabitants.&lt;ref name=GUNN23-24&gt;Gunn (1819:23–24).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern had meanwhile incurred the wrath of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre]] (by taking his own daughter for a wife and having a son by her) and had gone into hiding at the advice of his counsel. But at length his son [[Vortimer]] engaged Hengist and Horsa and their men in battle, drove them back to Thanet and there enclosed them and beset them on the western flank. The war waxed and waned; the Saxons repeatedly gained ground and were repeatedly driven back.&lt;ref name=GUNN29&gt;Gunn (1819:29).&lt;/ref&gt; Vortimer attacked the Saxons four times: first enclosing the Saxons in Thanet, secondly fighting at the river [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent]], the third time at [[Battle of Aylesford|Epsford]], where both Horsa and Vortigern's son [[Catigern]] died, and lastly &quot;near the stone on the shore of the Gallic sea,&quot; where the Saxons were defeated and fled to their ships.

After a &quot;short interval&quot; Vortimer died and the Saxons became established, &quot;assisted by foreign pagans.&quot; Hengist convened his forces and sent to Vortigern an offer of peace. Vortigern accepted, and Hengist prepared a feast to bring together the British and Saxon leaders.&lt;ref name=GUNN30-31&gt;Gunn (1819:30–31).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he instructed his men to conceal knives beneath their feet. At the right moment, Hengist shouted ''nima der [[seax|sexa]]'' (get your knives) and his men massacred the unsuspecting Britons. However, they spared Vortigern, who ransomed himself by giving the Saxons Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, and other unnamed districts.&lt;ref name=GUNN31-32&gt;Gunn (1819:31–32).&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanus of Auxerre was acclaimed as commander of the British forces. By praying, singing [[hallelujah]] and crying to God, the Saxons were driven to the sea.  Germanus then prayed for three days and nights at Vortigern's castle and fire fell from heaven and engulfed the castle. Vortigern, Hengist's daughter, Vortigern's other wives, and all other inhabitants burned to death. Potential alternate fates for Vortigern are provided.&lt;ref name=GUNN33&gt;Gunn (1819:33).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Saxons continued to increase in numbers, and after Hengist died his son Ochta succeeded him.&lt;ref name=GUNN34&gt;Gunn (1819:34).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''History of the Kings of Britain''===
[[File:Hamilton Vortigern &amp; Rowena.jpg|thumb|Vortigern and Rowena, by [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]] (1793)]]
In his pseudo-historical twelfth century work ''[[The History of the Kings of Britain]]'', [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] adapted and greatly expanded the account in the ''History of the Britons''. Hengist and Horsa appear in books 6 and 8:

====Book 6====
Geoffrey records that three [[brigandines]] or long galleys arrived in Kent, full of armed men and commanded by two brothers, Hengist and Horsa. Vortigern was then staying at Dorobernia ([[Canterbury]]), and ordered that the &quot;tall strangers&quot; be received peacefully and brought to him. When Vortigern saw the company, he immediately observed that the brothers &quot;excelled all the rest both in nobility and in gracefulness of person.&quot; He asked what country they had come from and why they had come to his kingdom. Hengist (&quot;whose years and wisdom entitled him to precedence&quot;) replied that they had left their homeland of Saxony to offer their services to Vortigern or some other prince, as part of a Saxon custom in which, when the country became overpopulated, able young men were chosen by lot to seek their fortunes in other lands. Hengist and Horsa were made generals over the exiles, as befitted their noble birth.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON116-117&gt;Thompson (1842:116–117).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern was aggrieved when he learned that the strangers were pagans, but nonetheless rejoiced at their arrival, since he was surrounded by enemies. He asked Hengist and Horsa if they would help him in his wars, offering them land and &quot;other possessions.&quot; They accepted the offer, settled on an agreement, and stayed with Vortigern at his court. Soon after, the Picts came from [[Alba]] with an immense army and attacked the northern parts of Vortigern's kingdom. In the ensuing battle &quot;there was little occasion for the Britons to exert themselves, for the Saxons fought so bravely, that the enemy, formerly victorious, were speedily put to flight.&quot;&lt;ref name=THOMPSON117-118&gt;Thompson (117–118).&lt;/ref&gt;

In gratitude Vortigern increased the rewards he has promised to the brothers. Hengist was given &quot;large possessions of lands in [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] for the subsistence of himself and his fellow-soldiers.&quot; A &quot;man of experience and subtilty,&quot; Hengist told Vortigern that his enemies assailed him from every quarter, and that his subjects wished to depose him and make [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] king. He asked the king to allow him to send word to Saxony for more soldiers. Vortigern agreed, adding that Hengist could invite over whom he pleases and that &quot;you shall have no refusal from me in whatever you shall desire.&quot;&lt;ref name=THOMPSON118-119&gt;Thompson (1842:118–119).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hengist bowed low in thanks, and made a further request, that he be made a consul or prince, as befitted his birth. Vortigern responded that it was not in his power to do this, reasoning that Hengist was a foreign pagan and would not be accepted by the British lords. Hengist asked instead for leave to build a fortress on a piece of land small enough that it could be encircled by a leather thong.  Vortigern granted this and ordered Hengist to invite more Saxons.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON118-119&gt;Thompson (1842:118–119).&lt;/ref&gt;

After executing Vortigern's orders, Hengist took a bull's hide and made it into a single thong, which he used to encircle a carefully-chosen rocky place (perhaps at [[Caistor]] in Lindsey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of King Arthur|last=Ashley|first=Michael|date=2005|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nBWeBAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson]]|isbn=1472107659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he built the castle of ''Kaercorrei'', or in Saxon ''Thancastre'': &quot;thong castle.&quot;&lt;ref name=THOMPSON119&gt;Thompson (1842:119).&lt;/ref&gt;

The messengers returned from Germany with eighteen ships full of the best soldiers they could get, as well as Hengist's beautiful daughter [[Rowena]]. Hengist invited Vortigern to see his new castle and the newly arrived soldiers. A banquet was held in Thancastre, at which Vortigern drunkenly asked Hengist to let him marry Rowena. Horsa and the men all agreed that Hengist should allow the marriage, on the condition that Vortigern gave him Kent.&lt;ref name=THOMPSOIN120-121&gt;Thompson (1842:120–121).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern and Rowena were immediately married and Hengist was given Kent. The king was delighted with his new wife, but he incurred the hatred of his nobles and of his three sons.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON121&gt;Thompson (1842:121).&lt;/ref&gt;

As his new father-in-law, Hengist made further demands of Vortigern:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:As I am your father, I claim the right of being your counsellor: do not therefore slight my advice, since it is to my countrymen you must owe the conquest of all your enemies. Let us invite over my son Octa, and his brother Ebissa, who are brave soldiers, and give them the countries that are in the northern parts of Britain, by [[Hadrian's wall|the wall]], between [[Deira]] and Alba. For they will hinder the inroads of the barbarians, and so you shall enjoy peace on the other side of the [[Humber]].&lt;ref name=THOMPSON121-122&gt;Thompson (1842:121–122).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vortigern agreed. Upon receiving the invitation, Octa, Ebissa, and another lord, [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cherdich]], immediately left for Britain with three hundred ships. Vortigern received them kindly, and gave them ample gifts. With their assistance, Vortigern defeated his enemies in every engagement. All the while Hengist continued inviting over yet more ships, adding to his numbers daily. Witnessing this, the Britons tried to get Vortigern to banish the Saxons, but on account of his wife he would not. Consequently, his subjects turned against him and took his son Vortimer for their king. The Saxons and the Britons, led by Vortimer, met in four battles. In the second, Horsa and Vortimer's brother, Catigern, slew one another. By the fourth battle, the Saxons had fled to Thanet, where Vortimer besieged them. When the Saxons could no longer bear the British onslaughts, they sent out Vortigern to ask his son to allow them safe passage back to Germany. While discussions were taking place, the Saxons boarded their ships and left, leaving their wives and children behind.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON122-123&gt;Thompson (1842:122–123).&lt;/ref&gt;

The victorious Vortimer was poisoned by Rowena, and Vortigern returned to the throne.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON123&gt;Thompson (1842:123).&lt;/ref&gt; At his wife's request he invited Hengist back to Britain, but instructed him to bring only a small retinue. Hengist, knowing Vortimer to be dead, instead raised an army of 300,000 men. When Vortigern caught word of the imminent arrival of the vast Saxon fleet, he resolved to fight them. Rowena alerted her father of this, who, after considering various strategies, resolved to make a show of peace and sent ambassadors to Vortigern.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON124-125&gt;Thompson (1842:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambassadors informed Vortigern that Hengist had only brought so many men because he did not know of Vortimer's death and feared further attacks from him. Now that there was no threat, Vortigern could choose from among the men the ones he wished to return to Germany. Vortigern was greatly pleased by these tidings, and arranged to meet Hengist on the first of May at the monastery of Ambrius.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON125&gt;Thompson (1842:125).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the meeting, Hengist ordered his soldiers to carry long daggers beneath their clothing. At the signal ''Nemet oure Saxas'' (get your knives), the Saxons fell upon the unsuspecting Britons and massacred them, while Hengist held Vortigern by his cloak. 460 British barons and consuls were killed, as well as some Saxons whom the Britons beat to death with club and stones. Vortigern was held captive and threatened with death until he resigned control of Britain's chief cities to Hengist. Once free, he fled to [[Cambria]].&lt;ref name=THOMPSON125-126&gt;Thompson (1842:125–126).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book 8====
In Cambria, [[Merlin]] prophesied to Vortigern that the brothers [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon]], who had fled to [[Armorica]] as children after Vortigern killed their brother and father, would return to have their revenge and defeat the Saxons. They arrived the next day, and, after rallying the dispersed Britons, Aurelius was proclaimed king. Aurelius marched into Cambria and burned Vortigern alive in his tower, before setting his sights upon the Saxons.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON149&gt;Thompson (1842:149).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hengist was struck by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the approach of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not to be afraid of Aurelius, for he had brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near [[Sheffield]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=English |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Maisbeli: A Place-Name Problem from Geoffrey of Monmouth |url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/1/11.short?rss=1 |journal=Notes &amp; Queries |volume=259 |pages=11–13 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON149/&gt;

As they marched to meet the Saxons, [[Eldol, Consul of Gloucester|Eldol]], Duke of [[Gloucester]] told Aurelius that he greatly wished to meet Hengist in combat, noting that &quot;one of the two of us should die before we parted.&quot; He explained that he had been at the Treachery of the Long Knives, but had escaped when God threw him a stake to defend himself with, making him the only Briton present to survive. Meanwhile, Hengist was placing his troops into formation, giving directions, and walking through the lines of troops, &quot;the more to spirit them up.&quot;&lt;ref name=THOMPSON150-151&gt;Thompson (1842:150–151).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the armies in formation, battle began between the Britons and Saxons, both sides shedding &quot;no small loss of blood.&quot; Eldol focused on attempting to find Hengist, but had no opportunity to fight him. &quot;By the especial favour of God,&quot; the Britons took the upper hand, and the Saxons withdrew and made for Kaerconan ([[Conisbrough]]). Aurelius pursued them, killing or enslaving any Saxon he met on the way. Realizing Kaerconan would not hold against Aurelius, Hengist stopped outside the town and ordered his men to make a stand, &quot;for he knew that his whole security now lay in his sword.&quot;&lt;ref name=THOMPSON151-152&gt;Thompson (1842:151–152).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurelius reached Hengist, and a &quot;most furious&quot; fight ensued, with the Saxons maintaining their ground despite heavy losses. They came close to winning before a detachment of horses from the Armorican Britons arrived. When [[Gorlois]], Duke of [[Cornwall]] arrived, Eldol knew the day was won and grabbed Hengist's helmet, dragging him into the British ranks. The Saxons fled. Hengist's son Octa retreated to [[York]] and his kinsman Eosa to Alclud ([[Dumbarton]]).&lt;ref name=THOMPSON153&gt;Thompson (1842:153).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the battle, Aurelius called together a council of principal officers to decide what would be done with Hengist. Eldol's brother Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Though all should be unanimous for setting him at liberty, yet would I cut him to pieces. The prophet [[Samuel (bible)|Samuel]] is my warrant, who, when he had [[Agag]], king of [[Amalek]], in his power, hewed him in pieces, saying, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. Do therefore the same to Hengist, who is a second Agag.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON154&gt;Thompson (1842:154).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Consequently, Eldol drew Hengist out of the city and cut off his head. Aurelius, &quot;who showed moderation in all his conduct,&quot; arranged for him to be buried and for a [[Tumulus|mound]] to be raised over his corpse, according to the custom of pagans.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON154/&gt; Octa and Eosa surrendered to Aurelius, who granted them the country bordering Scotland and made a firm covenant with them.&lt;ref name=THOMPSON154-155&gt;Thompson (1842:154–155).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
Hengist is briefly mentioned in ''[[Prologue (Prose Edda)|Prologue]]'', the first book of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the 13th century. In ''Prologue'', a [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of Germanic history is given, including that Woden put three of his sons in charge of Saxony. The ruler of eastern Saxony was Veggdegg, one of whose sons was Vitrgils, the father of Vitta, the father of Hengist.&lt;ref name=FAULKES4&gt;Faulkes (1995:4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horse-head gables==
On farmhouses in [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]], horse-head [[gable]]s were referred to as &quot;Hengst und Hors&quot; as late as around 1875. [[Rudolf Simek]] notes that these horse heads gables can still be seen today, and says that the horse-head gables confirm that Hengist and Horsa were originally considered mythological, horse-shaped beings.&lt;ref name=SIMEK139&gt;Simek (2007:139).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] comments that the horse heads may have been remnants of pagan religious practices in the area.&lt;ref name=WEST190&gt;West (2007:190).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Theories==
===''Finnsburg Fragment'' and ''Beowulf''===
A Hengest appears in line 34 of the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'', which describes the legendary [[Battle of Finnsburg]]. In ''[[Beowulf]]'', a [[scop]] recites a composition summarizing the Finnsburg events, including information not provided in the fragment. Hengest is mentioned in lines 1082 and 1091.&lt;ref name=CHICKERINGJR111AND113&gt;Chickering Jr. (2006:111 and 1113).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have proposed that the figure mentioned in both of these references is one and the same as the Hengist of the Hengist and Horsa accounts, though Horsa is not mentioned in either source. In his work ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', Tolkien argued that Hengist was a historical figure, and that Hengist came to Britain after the events recorded in the ''Finnsburg Fragment'' and ''Beowulf''. [[Patrick Sims-Williams]] is more skeptical of the account, suggesting that Bede's Canterbury source, which he relied on for his account of Hengist and Horsa in the ''Ecclesiastical History'', had confused two separate traditions.&lt;ref name=WALLACE-HADRILL215&gt;Wallace-Hadrall (1993:215).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic twin brothers and divine Indo-European horse twins===
Several sources attest that the Germanic peoples venerated a divine pair of twin brothers. The earliest reference to this practice derives from [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] (c. 345 – c. 250 BC). Timeaus records that the Germanic peoples (whom he refers to as &quot;Celts&quot;) of the [[North Sea]] were especially devoted to [[Interpretatio graeca|what he describes as]] [[Castor and Pollux]]. In his work  ''Germania'', [[Tacitus]] records the veneration of the [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]], whom he identifies with Castor and Pollux. Germanic legends mention various brothers as founding figures. The 1st or 2nd century historian [[Cassius Dio]] cites the brothers [[Raos and Raptos]] as the leaders of the [[Hasdingi|Astings]]. According to [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th century ''[[History of the Lombards]]'', the [[Lombards]] migrated southward from Scandinavia led by [[Ibur and Aio]], while [[Saxo Grammaticus]] records in his 12th century ''[[Gesta Danorum|Deeds of the Danes]]'' that this migration was prompted by [[Aggi and Ebbi]]. In related Indo-European cultures, similar traditions are attested, such as the [[Dioscuri]]. Scholars have theorized that these divine twins in Indo-European cultures stem from divine twins in prehistoric Proto-Indo-European culture.&lt;ref name=PROTO-INDO&gt;Simek (2007:59–60) and Mallory (2005:135).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. P. Mallory]] comments on the great importance of the horse in Indo-European religion, as exemplified &quot;most obviously&quot; by various mythical brothers appearing in Indo-European legend, including Hengist and Horsa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Some would maintain that the ''premier'' animal of the Indo-European sacrifice and ritual was probably the horse. We have already seen how its embedment in Proto-Indo-European society lies not just in its lexical reconstruction but also in the proliferation of personal names which contain &quot;horse&quot; as an element among the various Indo-European peoples. Furthermore, we witness the importance of the horse in Indo-European rituals and mythology. One of the most obvious examples is the recurrent depiction of twins such as the Indic Asvins &quot;horsemen,&quot; the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, the legendary Anglo-Saxon settlers Horsa and Hengist [...] or the Irish twins of [[Macha]], born after she had completed a horse race. All of these attest the existence of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses.&lt;ref name=MALLORY135/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Uffington White Horse===
[[File:White horse from air.jpg|thumb|The [[Uffington White Horse]]]]
In his 17th century work ''Monumenta Britannica'', [[John Aubrey]] ascribes the [[Uffington White Horse]] [[hill figure]] to Hengist and Horsa, stating that &quot;the White Horse was their Standard at the Conquest of Britain&quot;. However, elsewhere he ascribes the origins of the horse to the pre-Roman Britons, reasoning that the horse resembles certain Iron Age British coins. As a result, advocates of a Saxon origin of the figure debated with those favoring an ancient British origin for three centuries after Aubrey's findings. In 1995, using [[optically stimulated luminescence]] dating, David Miles and Simon Palmer of the [[Oxford Archaeology|Oxford Archaeological Unit]] assigned the Uffington White Horse to the late [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=SCHWYZER45AND56&gt;Schwyzer (1999:45 and 56).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aschanes===
The [[Brothers Grimm]] identified Hengist with [[Aschanes]], mythical first King of the Saxons, in their notes for legend number 413 of their ''German Legends''.&lt;ref&gt;''The German Legends of the Brothers Grimm'' volume 2, edited and translated by Donald Ward, Millington Books, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Editor and translator Donald Ward, in his commentary on the tale, regards the identification as untenable on linguistic grounds.

==Modern influence==
Hengist and Horsa have appeared in a variety of media in the modern period. Written between 1616 and 1620, [[Thomas Middleton]]'s play ''[[Hengist, King of Kent]]'' features portrayals of both Hengist and Horsa (as ''Hersus'').&lt;ref name=TAYLORLAVAGNINO1448&gt;Taylor. Lavagnino (2007:1148).&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 6, 1776, the first committee for the production of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] convened. One of three members of the committee, [[Thomas Jefferson]], proposed that one side of the seal feature Hengist and Horsa, &quot;the Saxon chiefs from whom we claim the honor of being descended, and whose political principles and form of government we assumed&quot;.&lt;ref name=MERILL98&gt;Merill (1970:98).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Hengist and Horsus&quot; appear as antagonists in [[William Henry Ireland]]'s play ''[[Vortigern and Rowena]]'', which was touted as a newly discovered work by [[William Shakespeare]] in 1796, but was soon revealed as a hoax.&lt;ref name=&quot;CamelotProject&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/ireland.htm|title= Vortigern |work= The Camelot Project|publisher= University of Rochester|date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair have plaques in the [[Walhalla Temple]] at [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], which honours distinguished figures of German history.&lt;ref name=EVERILL12&gt;Everill (1845:12).&lt;/ref&gt; 

During [[World War II]], two British [[military glider]]s took their names from the brothers: the [[Slingsby Hengist]]&lt;ref name=NIGL19&gt;Nigl (2007:19).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Airspeed Horsa]].&lt;ref name=FREDERIKSEN14&gt;Frédriksen (2001:14).&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century American poet [[Robinson Jeffers]] composed a poem titled ''Ode to Hengist and Horsa''.&lt;ref name=HUNT423&gt;Hunt (1991:423).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, [[Prince George Valdemar of Denmark|Prince Georg of Denmark]] came to [[Pegwell Bay]] in Kent to dedicate the longship ''[[Hugin (longship)|Hugin]]'', commemorating the landing of Hengest and Horsa at nearby Ebbsfleet 1500 years earlier in 449 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WME8QE_Beginning_of_English_History_Commemoration_Stone_Pegwell_Bay_Kent_UK | title = Beginning of English History&quot; Commemoration Stone - Pegwell Bay, Kent, UK - UK Historical Markers on Waymarking.com | accessdate = 2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hengist and Horsa are not referenced in the medieval tales of [[King Arthur]], some modern Arthurian tales do link them. For example, in [[Mary Stewart (novelist) |Mary Stewart]]'s ''[[Merlin Trilogy]]'' it is King Arthur who kills Hengist. In [[Alfred Duggan]]'s ''[[Conscience of the King]]'', Hengist plays a major role in the early career of [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic Elesing]], legendary founder of the kingdom of Wessex.

The '''''Hero System''''' is a [[generic role-playing game system]] that was developed from the [[superhero]] [[role playing game|RPG]] ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]''.  After ''Champions'' fourth edition was released in 1989, a stripped-down version of its ruleset with no superhero or other genre elements was released as ''The Hero System Rulesbook'' in 1990.  As a spinoff of ''Champions'', the ''Hero System'' is considered to have started with 4th edition (as it is mechanically identical to ''Champions'' 4th edition), rather than on its own with a 1st edition.  However, the first three editions of the game are typically referred to as ''Champions'', rather than the Hero System, as the game for its first three editions was not sold as a universal toolkit, instead largely focusing on superheroes.

The ''Hero System'' is used as the underlying [[game mechanics|mechanics]] of other [[Hero Games]] role-playing games such as ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'', ''[[Star Hero]]'', and ''[[Pulp Hero]]''.  It is characterized by point-based character creation and the rigor with which it measures character abilities. It uses only six-sided [[dice]].

==System features==
The ''Hero System'' uses ''Champions''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' key system features.  Tasks are resolved using three six-sided dice and power effects (especially damage) are resolved by rolling a number of dice based on the power's strength.

Like ''Champions'', it uses tool-kit approach to creating effects.  While the system does have more typical features of many RPGs, such as a skill system, most abilities in the ''Hero System'' rules are listed as a generic &quot;powers&quot;.  Most powers are meant to be able to model a vast number of potential effects.  When creating a character, a player decides on what effect they wish to create, then constructs this effect by consulting the powers in the rulebook.  Most powers have a set of modifiers that alter its base performance to more finely-tune its representation of the effect desired.  Each such modifier makes the power more or less capable, and correspondingly more or less expensive to purchase with character points (the &quot;currency&quot; used to buy powers; see the section following).  The result is that many effects are possible from the exact same base power.  For example, while systems such as [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] would list a wide variety of separate ranged attack powers that deal damage (such as a fireball, a lightning bolt, an acid spray, a magic missile, and dozens more), the vast majority of such effects in the ''Hero System'' would be constructed out of the same base two powers, &quot;Blast&quot; or &quot;Killing Attack&quot;.

The ''Hero System'' rules only define an ability's very basic mechanical effects—the player is the one who defines what the ability looks like when used.  For example, if a player wishes to model the ability to project a jet of fire, they could choose the &quot;Blast&quot; power.  However, the power's text has no mention of what it looks like or how it operates beyond some very base notes concerning damage and range.  To make it a jet of fire, the player simply states that this Blast is a jet of fire.  To some degree this is simply cosmetic.  However, in the game, that power now is treated as a fire attack, with all that implies as decided by the gamemaster in each situation: it has the possibility of starting secondary fires; it looks, smells and sounds like a jet of fire; will not work in water; will terrify people with a phobia of fire; etc.  The system does have mechanical effect alterations as well: a Blast could be altered by any number of power modifiers such as &quot;Explosion&quot;, &quot;Area of Effect&quot;, &quot;Megascale&quot;, etc.: both advantages and disadvantages are available.  As players are typically attempting to model something with at least a partial real-life analogue, limitations on a power are as much about making it more accurate a representation as they are making it less expensive to purchase (for example, to model a firearm, the limitation that it requires ammunition is expected, regardless of the fact that this happens to make a firearm cost fewer character points).  The system also allows players to construct very exacting modifiers not specifically detailed in the base rules.  For example, a player could define one or more powers as not working when the moon is full, or when it is Tuesday, or any other limitation that the player can imagine and the gamemaster feels is applicable.

Also like ''Champions'', the ''Hero System'' uses a point-based system for character creation.  Instead of templates which define what a character is, how it performs mechanically, and the new abilities gained after a certain amount of play, a player is given a fixed amount of points and allowed to create what they want.  As this is a much more freeform process than in most games, the system encourages close involvement between players and gamemasters to ensure that all participants have the same understanding regarding the type of effects permitted, relative power levels, and the like.

===Character creation===
Each player creates his character starting with a pool of points to buy abilities (such as the aforementioned &quot;Energy Blast&quot; and &quot;Armor&quot;), increase characteristics (such as &quot;Strength&quot; and &quot;Intelligence&quot;) and buy skills (such as &quot;Computer Programming&quot; and &quot;Combat Driving&quot;).  This pool can be increased by taking disadvantages for your character (such as being hunted by an enemy, a dependency of some sort or having people who depend on your character in some way).  The initial pool, as well as the final pool size, is determined by the [[gamemaster|Game Master]] (GM), as well as the point limits on each individual ability.

{{Quote|text=&quot;You build Hero System characters with Character Points. You purchase everything a character can do — from his ability to lift heavy objects, to his skill with weapons, to his ability to use magic or superpowers — with Character Points. Your GM will tell you how many points you have to build your character with — the more points, the more powerful the character, generally. You can spend most of your Character Points without any requirements, but you only get to spend some of them if you take a matching value of Complications for your character. Complications are disadvantages, hindrances, and difficulties that affect a character and thus help you to define who he is and properly simulate the concept you have in mind for him. For example, your character might be Hunted by an old enemy, or adhere to a Code Of Honor, or be missing one eye. [. . .] There are five things a character can buy with Character Points: Characteristics, Skills, Perks, Talents, and Powers.&quot; - excerpt from Hero System Sixth Edition Volume 1|sign=|source=}}

Unlike the [[d20 System]] and many other game systems, experience awards are in the form of character points, which have the same value as those used in character creation and can be applied directly to the character's abilities upon receipt.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
The advantages of the ''Hero System ''are commonly{{Who|date=September 2010}} considered to be:

#It eases [[game balance]] issues for the GM: characters of similar point totals are usually of roughly equal power.
#It is very flexible in character creation, allowing players to create nearly any character they can imagine.
#It uses only six-sided [[dice]], as generally used in many board games.

The primary disadvantages are sometimes considered to be:

#Complexity, as character generation provides a sometimes overwhelming number of options and requires more mathematical computation than other games (but see [[#Mathematics issues|&quot;Mathematics issues&quot;]] below).
#The great amount of time it can take to adjudicate combat.
#The ability for players familiar with the system's quirks to use the system to decrease the point cost of powers, leading to one character being much more powerful than another character of similar point value.
#A large number of dice required at high power levels

The &quot;large number of dice required at high power levels&quot; has been called both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The original designers, and some contemporary players, have cited a &quot;feeling of power&quot; when rolling large numbers of dice and counting off huge amounts of damage.  On the other hand, rolling such a large load of dice can be physically unwieldy and take a long time to add up.

===Powers===
The powers system is divided into a set of standard powers, and a list of advantages and limitations that can be applied to each power. Many of the powers have specific advantages and limitations that apply only to that power. The powers in the Hero System are categorized roughly as follows:

:*'''Adjustment Powers''' — Modify the Characteristics of self or another.
:*'''Attack Powers''' — Inflict physical damage or some other negative effect on an opponent.
:*'''Body-Affecting Powers''' — Change shape, size, density, etc.
:*'''Defense Powers''' — Protect against an attack or mishap.
:*'''Mental Powers''' — Detect and/or affect the mind of another.
:*'''Movement Powers''' — Employ various forms of movement.
:*'''Sense-Affecting Powers''' — Alter or hinder a character's senses.
:*'''Sensory Powers''' — Improve or expand upon the sensory abilities.
:*'''Size Powers''' — Growth and Shrinking.
:*'''Special Powers''' — Powers with some unusual quality, including ones that do not fall into the other categories.
:*'''Standard Powers''' — A &quot;catch-all&quot; for Powers that are not Adjustment, Mental, Movement, Size, or Special Powers.

Within each of these categories are multiple Powers that have more specialized effects. Thus for the movement category there are powers that can be used for [[Running]], [[human swimming|Swimming]], [[Climbing]], [[Jumping|Leaping]], [[Gliding]], [[flight|Flying]], [[Tunnel]]ing through solid surfaces, and even [[Teleportation]]. For certain game [[genre]]s there are even powers for traveling to other dimensions or moving faster than light.

Also, many Powers appear in at least two categories.  For example, most Attack Powers are also Standard Powers, and Size Powers are basically just a subcategory of Body-Affecting Powers.  Darkness is in three categories — Standard, Attack, and Sense-Affecting.

====Point Cost====
Each power has a base point cost for a given effect. This could be, for example, a certain number of points per six-sided-die (or &quot;d6&quot;) of damage inflicted upon a foe.

Powers can have both advantages and limitations.  Both are modifiers applied at different stages in calculating cost.  These modifiers are typically changes of ±¼, but can range up to ±2 or even higher.

After the base cost is calculated, advantages are applied.  These, which can make a power more useful, typically expand its effectiveness or make it more powerful, and thus make it more expensive.  Once advantages are applied, the base cost becomes the Active Cost.

The Active Cost is calculated as an intermediate step as it is required to calculate certain figures, such as range, END usage, difficulty of activation rolls, and other things.

The formula for calculating the Active Cost is:
:'''Active Cost''' = '''Base Cost''' &amp;times; (1 + ''Advantages'')

Once Active Cost is calculated, limitations are applied.  These represent shortcomings in the power, lessened reliability or situations in which the power can not be used.  Limitations are added separately as positive numbers, even though they are listed as negative.

The Real Cost of the power is then determined by:
:'''Real Cost''' = '''Active Cost''' / (1 + ''Limitations'')

The Real Cost is the amount the character must actually pay for the Power.

====Power Frameworks====
The rules also include schemes for providing a larger number of powers to a character for a given cost. These power frameworks reduce the cost either by requiring the group of powers to have a common theme as in an Elemental Control Framework, or by limiting the number of powers that can be active at one time with a Multipower Framework. Powers within a framework can share common limitations, further reducing the cost. A third type of power framework, the Variable Power Pool (VPP), trades thrift for flexibility. With it, powers can be arbitrarily chosen on the fly, granting enhanced in-game flexibility. The price is a premium on points, called the Control Cost.  Additionally, it is marked as potentially unbalancing, so not all GMs will permit VPP's.

Elemental Controls were eliminated in the Sixth Edition.

===Mathematics issues===
One of the criticisms leveled at the ''Hero System'' almost since its inception is the relatively large amount of computation involved in its use, particularly during character creation. While almost none of this math goes beyond the basic functions of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]], this can seem daunting to newcomers.

As a result, [[software]] has been created to automate the bookkeeping involved. &quot;Heromaker&quot;, an [[MS-DOS]] program, was distributed with some versions of [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]. Today, &quot;Hero Designer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herodesigner.com/home.htm &quot;Hero Designer: Character creation software for Hero System, 5th Edition&quot;], vendor website&lt;/ref&gt; for the Fifth and Sixth Editions is available on several platforms, and is supported by numerous character packs and other extensions linked to Hero Games book releases.

==Publishing history==
{{see also|List of Hero System Products}}

Although several games based on what would become known as the ''Hero System'' were published in the 1980s, including ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'', ''[[Danger International]]'', ''[[Justice, Inc. (role-playing game)|Justice, Inc.]]'', ''[[Robot Warriors]]'' and the original versions of ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'' and ''[[Star Hero]]'', each of the RPGs was self-contained, much as [[Chaosium]]'s [[Basic Role-Playing]] games are. The ''Hero System'' itself was not released as an independent entity until 1990, as [[Steve Jackson Games]]' ''[[GURPS]]'' (''Generic Universal Roleplaying System'') became more popular. As a joint venture between Hero Games and [[Iron Crown Enterprises]], a stand-alone ''Hero System Rulebook'' was published alongside the fourth edition of Champions. The content was identical to the opening sections of the Champions rules, but all genre-related material was removed. Afterward, genre books such as ''Ninja Hero'' (written by [[Aaron Allston]]) and ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'' were published as sourcebooks for the ''Hero System Rulebook'' as opposed to being independent games.

With the collapse of the Hero-ICE alliance, the ''Hero System'' went into limbo for several years. ''The Champions'' franchise released a new version under the [[Fuzion]] system, which had been a joint development with [[R. Talsorian Games]], called ''Champions: the New Millennium''. Although two editions were published, it was very poorly received by ''Champions'' fans. In 2001, a reconstituted Hero Games was formed under the leadership of [[Steven S. Long]], who had written several books for the earlier version of the system. It regained the rights to the ''Hero System'' and to the ''Champions'' trademark.

In 2001, the Fifth Edition of the ''Hero System Rulebook'' was released, incorporating heavy revisions by Long. A large black hardcover, it was critically well received and attained a degree of commercial success. (Following problems with fragile [[Bookbinding|bindings]] on Fourth Edition rulebooks, the planned binding for the larger Fifth Edition was tested using a clothes dryer.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123133645/http://herogames.com/news/2002/0125.jsp &quot;News&quot;], Hero Games website, January 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;) The Fifth Edition is often referred to as &quot;FREd&quot;, which is a [[backronym]] for &quot;Fifth Rules Edition&quot;. The name actually comes from Steve S. Long's reply when asked what the standard abbreviation for the Fifth Edition would be: &quot;I don't care if you call it 'Fred', as long as you buy it.&quot; This was made the unofficial nickname by several replies on the same board affirming it after a reply from Willpower, who coined the backronym by saying, &quot;OK. FREd it is, &quot;Fifth Rules Edition&quot;!&quot; 

A revised version ({{ISBN|1-58366-043-7}}) was issued in 2004, along with ''Hero System Sidekick'', a condensed version of the rulebook with a cover price of under $10. Fans often call the revised Fifth Edition &quot;Fiver,&quot; ReFREd,&quot; or &quot;5ER&quot; (from &quot;Fifth Edition revised&quot;; &quot;Fiver&quot; also alludes to ''[[Watership Down]]''). This rulebook is so big (592 pages) that some fans speculated that it might be bulletproof, and it did indeed stop some bullets when tested by Hero Games staffers.&lt;ref&gt;

On February 28, 2008, [[Cryptic Studios]] purchased the ''Champions'' [[intellectual property]], and sold the rights back to Hero Games to publish the 6th edition books. One of the new features will be to allow players to adapt their ''[[Champions Online]]'' characters to the pen-and-paper game.&lt;ref name=&quot;championspurchase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crypticstudios.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=174&amp;Itemid=32|title=Cryptic Studios Announces Champions Online|publisher=[[Cryptic Studios]]|quote=Cryptic Studios also announced today that it has acquired the ''Champions'' intellectual property (IP) from Hero Games. First published in 1981, the ''Champions'' role-playing game is one of the first RPGs to forgo the traditional dice-rolling system of character generation in favor of a point-based system. Cryptic Studios has licensed back to Hero Games the rights to produce Champions RPG books, and the sixth edition of the Hero System and ''Champions'', set to release in 2009, will include rules on how to recreate Champions Online characters and scenarios.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, Hero released a licensed RPG for [[Aaron Williams (cartoonist)|Aaron Williams]]'s popular comic [[PS238]] using a simplified version of the Fifth Edition rules.

In late 2009, Hero Games released the 6th Edition of the Hero System. The game has so far had a mostly positive reception, with little in the way of 'Edition Wars'. The largest rules change was the removal of Figured Characteristics (meaning that character stats that were previously linked intrinsically—such as Speed automatically increasing when sufficient amounts of Dexterity were purchased—were no longer connected, and instead bought entirely separately). Other, more minor rules changes include folding Armor and Force field into Resistant Defense and reestablishing Regeneration as a separate power. The rules were released in two volumes, with the first covering character creation in depth and the second describing campaigns and the running of games. The new genre book for Champions came out shortly thereafter, and a new ''Fantasy Hero'' was released in the summer of 2010. A new version of Sidekick was released in late 2009 under the title ''The Hero System Basic Rulebook'', while an Advanced Player Guide was published that had additional options for character creation. Other recent releases included a large book of pre-constructed Powers, a set of pre-generated Martial Arts styles, abilities and skills, a large bestiary, a new [[grimoire]] for Fantasy Hero and a three-volume set of villains for ''Champions''. A new edition of ''Star Hero'' was released in 2011, along with a second Advanced Player Guide.

On 28 November 2011, Hero Games announced a restructuring, with Darren Watts and long-time developer Steven S. Long relinquishing their full-time statuses to work freelance. In late 2012 ''Champions Complete'' was released, which contained all of the core 6th edition rules as well as enough information to play a superhero campaign in a single 240-page book. This compact presentation reflected criticism that the 6th edition rules had become too unwieldy.
Mirroring the shrinking of much of the table-top RPG industry, Hero Games now maintains an irregular release schedule, with a minimal staff, and has successfully used [[Kickstarter]] to raise funds for new projects. One of these new products, ''Fantasy Hero Complete'', was released in early 2015.

'''Sir Humphry Davy, 1st Baronet''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PRS|MRIA|FGS}} (17 December 1778{{spaced ndash}}29 May 1829) was a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] [[chemist]] and inventor,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; who is best remembered today for isolating a series of substances for the first time: [[potassium]] and [[sodium]] in 1807 and [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[magnesium]] and [[boron]] the following year, as well as discovering the elemental nature of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. He also studied the forces involved in these separations, inventing the new field of [[electrochemistry]].

==Education, apprenticeship and poetry==
Davy was born in [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] on 17 December 1778. Davy's brother, John Davy, writes that the society of their hometown was characterised by &quot;an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural and monstrous [...] Amongst the middle and higher classes, there was little taste for literature, and still less for science [...] Hunting, shooting, wrestling, cockfighting, generally ending in drunkenness, were what they most delighted in&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy 1836&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Davy |first= John |authorlink = John Davy (chemist) |title = Memoirs of the Life of Sir Humphry Davy |volume = Vol. 1 of 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EOQ5AAAAcAAJ |location = London, UK|publisher = Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, &amp; Longman |year = 1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of six, Davy was sent to the grammar school at Penzance. Three years later, his family moved to Varfell, near [[Ludgvan]], and subsequently, in term-time Davy boarded with John Tonkin, his godfather and later his guardian.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; On leaving Penzance grammar school in 1793, Tonkin paid for Davy to attend [[Truro Grammar School]] in 1793 to finish his education under the Rev Dr Cardew, who, in a letter to [[Davies Gilbert]], said dryly: &quot;I could not discern the faculties by which he was afterwards so much distinguished.&quot; Yet, Davy entertained his school friends with writing poetry, Valentines, and telling stories from [[One Thousand and One Nights]]. Reflecting on his school days, in a letter to his mother, Davy wrote: &quot;Learning naturally is a true pleasure; how unfortunate then it is that in most schools it is made a pain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Knight |first= David |authorlink = David M.

After Davy's father died in 1794, Tonkin apprenticed him to John Bingham Borlase, a surgeon with a practice in Penzance. Davy's [[indenture]] is dated 10 February 1795. In the [[apothecary]]'s dispensary, Davy became a chemist, and conducted his earliest chemical experiments in a garret in Tonkin's house. Davy's friends said: &quot;This boy Humphry is incorrigible. He will blow us all into the air.&quot; His elder sister complained of the ravages made on her dresses by corrosive substances.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; Davy was taught French by a refugee priest, and in 1797 read Lavoisier's ''Traité élémentaire de chimie'': much of his future work can be seen as reacting against Lavoisier's work and the dominance of French chemists.

As a poet, over one hundred and sixty manuscript poems were written by Davy, the majority of which are found in his personal notebooks. Most of his written poems were not published, and he chose instead to share a few of them with his friends. Eight of his known poems were published. His poems reflected his views on both his career and also his pereception of certain aspects of human life. He wrote on human endeavours and aspects of life like death, metaphysics, geology, natural theology and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[John Ayrton Paris]] remarked that poetry written by the young Davy &quot;bear the stamp of lofty genius&quot;. Davy's first preserved poem entitled ''The Sons of Genius'' is dated 1795 and marked by the usual immaturity of youth. Other poems written in the following years, especially ''On the Mount's Bay'' and ''St Michael's Mount'', are descriptive verses, showing sensibility but no true poetic imagination. Three of Davy's paintings from around 1796 have been donated to the [[Penlee House]] museum at Penzance. One is of the view from above [[Gulval]] showing the church, [[Mount's Bay]] and [[St Michael's Mount|the Mount]], while the other two depict [[Loch Lomond]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anon|title=Davy paintings donated to museum|newspaper=[[The Cornishman]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davy's picture of Mounts Bay was included in the Penlee House exhibition &quot;Penzance 400: A Celebration of the History of Penzance&quot; 29 March – 7 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing verses at the age of 17 in honour of his first love, he was eagerly discussing the question of the materiality of heat with his [[Quaker]] friend and mentor [[Robert Dunkin]]. Dunkin remarked: 'I tell thee what, Humphry, thou art the most quibbling hand at a dispute I ever met with in my life.' One winter day he took Davy to the Larigan River,&lt;ref&gt;The Larigan, or Laregan, river is a stream in Penzance.&lt;/ref&gt; To show him that rubbing two plates of ice together developed sufficient energy by motion, to melt them, and that after the motion was suspended, the pieces were united by regelation. It was a crude form of analogous experiment exhibited by Davy in the lecture-room of the [[Royal Institution]] that elicited considerable attention.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; As professor at the [[Royal Institution]], Davy repeated many of the ingenious experiments he learned from his friend and mentor, Robert Dunkin.

Even though he initially started writing his poems albeit haphazardly, as a reflection of his views on his career, and on life generally, most of his final poems concentrated more on immortality and death. This was after he started experiencing failing health and a decline both in health and career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early scientific interests==
[[Davies Gilbert|Davies Giddy]] met Davy in [[Penzance]] carelessly swinging on the half-gate of Dr Borlase's house, and interested by his talk invited him to his house at Tredrea and offered him the use of his library. This led to an introduction to Dr Edwards, who lived at Hayle Copper House. Edwards was a lecturer in chemistry in the school of [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]]. He permitted Davy to use his laboratory and possibly directed his attention to the floodgates of the port of [[Hayle]], which were rapidly decaying as a result of the contact between copper and iron under the influence of [[seawater]]. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was not understood at that time, but the phenomenon prepared Davy's mind for subsequent experiments on ship's [[copper sheathing]]. Gregory Watt, son of [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]], visited Penzance for his health's sake, and while lodging at the Davy's house became a friend and gave him instructions in chemistry. Davy was acquainted with the [[Wedgwood]] family, who spent a winter at Penzance.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

[[Thomas Beddoes]] and [[John Hailstone]] were engaged in a geological controversy on the rival merits of the [[Plutonism|Plutonian]] and [[Neptunist]] hypotheses. They travelled together to examine the Cornish coast accompanied by Davies Gilbert and made Davy's acquaintance. Beddoes, who had established at [[Bristol]] a 'Pneumatic Institution,' needed an assistant to superintend the laboratory. Gilbert recommended Davy, and in 1798 Gregory Watt showed Beddoes the ''Young man's Researches on Heat and Light'', which were subsequently published by him in the first volume of ''West-Country Contributions''. After prolonged negotiations, mainly by Gilbert, Mrs Davy and Borlase consented to Davy's departure, but Tonkin wished him to remain in his native town as a surgeon, and altered his will when he found that Davy insisted on going to Dr Beddoes.

In 1802, Humphry Davy had what was then, the most powerful electrical battery in the world at the Royal Institution. With it, Davy created the first [[incandescent light]] by passing electric current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point. It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but demonstrated the principle. By 1806 he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the [[Royal Society]] in London. It was an early form of [[Arc lamp|arc light]] which produced its illumination from an electric arc created between two charcoal rods.

==Pneumatic Institution==
[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Watt]] in 1792 by [[Carl Frederik von Breda]]]]
On 2 October 1798, Davy joined the [[Pneumatic Institution]] at Bristol. It had been established to investigate the medical powers of factitious airs and gases (gases produced experimentally or artificially), and Davy was to superintend the various experiments. The arrangement agreed between Dr Beddoes and Davy was generous, and enabled Davy to give up all claims on his paternal property in favour of his mother. He did not intend to abandon the medical profession and was determined to study and graduate at Edinburgh, but he soon began to fill parts of the institution with voltaic batteries. While living in Bristol, Davy met the [[Earl of Durham]], who was a resident in the institution for his health, and became close friends with Gregory Watt, [[James Watt]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]], all of whom became regular users of [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas), to which Davy became addicted. The gas was first synthesized in 1772 by the [[natural philosopher]] and chemist [[Joseph Priestley]], who called it ''phlogisticated nitrous air'' (see [[phlogiston]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nitrous Oxide pioneers&quot; &gt;{{cite web

James Watt built a portable gas chamber to facilitate Davy's experiments with the inhalation of nitrous oxide. At one point the gas  was combined with wine to judge its efficacy as a cure for [[hangover]] (his laboratory notebook indicated success). The gas was popular among Davy's friends and acquaintances, and he noted that it might be useful for performing surgical operations.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1800 ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical'' (p.556), Davy commented: &quot;''As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anesthetic]]s were not regularly used in medicine or dentistry until decades after Davy's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot; &gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes |first=Richard|title=The Age of Wonder|publisher=Pantheon Books  |year=2008  |isbn=978-0-375-42222-5  |ref=Holmes, 2008, AOW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy threw himself energetically into the work of the laboratory and formed a long romantic friendship with Mrs Anna Beddoes, the novelist [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria Edgeworth's]] sister, who acted as his guide on walks and other fine sights of the locality. The critic Maurice Hindle was the first to reveal that Davy and Anna had written poems for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindle|first1=Maurice|title=Nature, Power, and the Light of Suns: The Poetry of Humphry Davy|url=http://mauricehindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nature-Power-the-Light-of-Suns-essay.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wahida Amin has transcribed and discussed a number of poems written between 1803 and 1808 to &quot;Anna&quot; and one to her infant child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amin|first1=Wahida|title=THE POETRY AND SCIENCE OF HUMPHRY DAVY|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/30795/1/Wahida_Amin_-_The_Poetry_and_Science_of_Humphry_Davy_-_23.01.14.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1799 Davy visited London for the first time and extended his circle of friends. Davy features in the diary of William Godwin, with their first meeting recorded for 4 December 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godwin|first1=William|title=William Godwin's Diary|url=http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/people/DAV03.html|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the gas experiments Davy ran considerable risks. His respiration of [[nitric oxide]] which may have combined with air in the mouth to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay2014&quot; /&gt; severely injured the mucous membrane, and in Davy's attempt to inhale four quarts of &quot;pure hydrocarbonate&quot; gas in an experiment with [[carbon monoxide]] he &quot;seemed sinking into annihilation.&quot; On being removed into the open air, Davy faintly articulated, &quot;I do not think I shall die,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay2014&quot; /&gt; but some hours elapsed before the painful symptoms ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; Davy was able to take his own pulse as he staggered out of the laboratory and into the garden, and he described it in his notes as &quot;threadlike and beating with excessive quickness&quot;.

In this year the first volume of the ''West-Country Collections'' was issued. Half consisted of Davy's essays ''On Heat, Light, and the Combinations of Light'', ''On Phos-oxygen and its Combinations'', and on the ''Theory of Respiration''. On 22 February 1799 Davy, wrote to Davies Gilbert, &quot;I am now as much convinced of the non-existence of [[Caloric theory|caloric]] as I am of the existence of light.&quot; In another letter to Gilbert, on 10 April, Davy informs him: &quot;I made a discovery yesterday which proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments. The gaseous oxide of azote (the laughing gas) is perfectly respirable when pure. It is never deleterious but when it contains nitrous gas. I have found a mode of making it pure.&quot; He said that he breathed sixteen quarts of it for nearly seven minutes, and that it &quot;absolutely intoxicated me.&quot;&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; 
Davy became increasingly well known in 1799 due to his experiments with the physiological action of some gases, including laughing gas (nitrous oxide). In addition to himself, his enthusiastic experimental subjects included his poet friends [[Robert Southey]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=Mike |title=&quot;O, Excellent Air Bag&quot;: Humphry Davy and Nitrous Oxide |journal= [[The Public Domain Review]]|date=8 August 2014 |volume=4 |issue=16 |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2014/08/06/o-excellent-air-bag-humphry-davy-and-nitrous-oxide/ |publisher=[[Open Knowledge Foundation]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=High Times|journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=36–39|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/distillations/magazine/high-times|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1799, Beddoes and Davy published ''Contributions to physical and medical knowledge, principally from the west of England'' and ''Essays on heat, light, and the combinations of light, with a new theory of respiration. On the generation of oxygen gas, and the causes of the colors of organic beings.'' Their experimental work was poor, and the publications were harshly criticized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon&quot;/&gt; In after years Davy regretted he had ever published these immature hypotheses, which he subsequently designated &quot;the dreams of misemployed genius which the light of experiment and observation has never conducted to truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

These criticisms, however, led Davy to refine and improve his experimental techniques,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon&quot;/&gt; spending his later time at the institution increasingly in experimentation.
In 1800, Davy informed Gilbert that he had been &quot;repeating the galvanic experiments with success&quot; in the intervals of the experiments on the gases, which &quot;almost incessantly occupied him from January to April.&quot; In 1800, Davy published his ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide and its Respiration'', and received a more positive response.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon&quot;/&gt;

[[William Wordsworth]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge moved to the [[Lake District]] in 1800, and asked Davy to deal with the Bristol publishers of the [[Lyrical Ballads]], Biggs &amp; Cottle. Coleridge asked Davy to proofread the second edition of the [[Lyrical Ballads]], the first to contain [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] [[Preface to the Lyrical Ballads|Preface]] in a letter dated 16 July 1800: &quot;Will you be so kind as just to look over the sheets of the lyrical Ballads&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|editor1-last=Griggs|editor1-first=E.

==Royal Institution==
In 1799, [[Count Rumford]] had proposed the establishment in London of an 'Institution for Diffusing Knowledge', i.e. the [[Royal Institution]]. The house in [[Albemarle Street]] was bought in April 1799.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=285}} Rumford became secretary to the institution, and Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] was the first lecturer.

Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] is the lecturer, holding the victim's nose.]]
In February 1801 Davy was interviewed by the committee of the Royal Institution, comprising [[Joseph Banks]], [[Benjamin Thompson]] (who had been appointed Count Rumford) and [[Henry Cavendish]]. Davy wrote to Davies Gilbert on 8 March 1801 about the offers made by Banks and Thompson, a possible move to London and the promise of funding for his work in galvanism. He also mentioned that he might not be collaborating further with Beddoes on therapeutic gases. The next day Davy left Bristol to take up his new post at the Royal Institution,&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt; it having been resolved 'that Humphry Davy be engaged in the service of the Royal Institution in the capacity of assistant lecturer in chemistry, director of the chemical laboratory, and assistant editor of the journals of the institution, and that he be allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished with coals and candles, and that he be paid a salary of 100l. per annum.'&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt;

On 25 April 1801, Davy gave his first lecture on the relatively new subject of 'Galvanism'. He and his friend Coleridge had had many conversations about the nature of human knowledge and progress, and Davy's lectures gave his audience a vision of human civilisation brought forward by scientific discovery. &quot;It [science] has bestowed on him powers which may almost be called creative; which have enabled him to modify and change the beings surrounding him, and by his experiments to interrogate nature with power, not simply as a scholar, passive and seeking only to understand her operations, but rather as a master, active with his own instruments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt; The first lecture garnered rave reviews, and by the June lecture Davy wrote to John King that his last lecture had attendance of nearly 500 people. &quot;There was Respiration, Nitrous Oxide, and unbounded Applause. Amen!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt;
Davy revelled in his public status.

Davy's lectures included spectacular and sometimes dangerous chemical demonstrations along with scientific information, and were presented with considerable showmanship by the young and handsome man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Left Behind|journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=40–43|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/distillations/magazine/left-behind|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Davy also included both poetic and religious commentary in his lectures, emphasizing that God's design was revealed by chemical investigations.   Religious commentary was in part an attempt to appeal to women in his audiences. Davy, like many of his enlightenment contemporaries, supported female education and women's involvement in scientific pursuits, even proposing that women be admitted to evening events at the Royal Society.
Davy acquired a large female following around London. In a satirical cartoon by Gillray, nearly half of the attendees pictured are female. His support of women caused Davy to be subjected to considerable gossip and innuendo, and to be criticized as unmanly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golinski&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golinski|first1=Jan|title=The Experimental Self: Humphry Davy and the Making of a Man of Science|date=2016|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226351360|pages=70–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Davy's lecture series on Galvanism ended, he progressed to a new series on [[Agricultural Chemistry]], and his popularity continued to skyrocket. By June 1802, after just over a year at the Institution and at the age of&amp;nbsp;23, Davy was nominated to full lecturer at the [[Royal Institution]] of Great Britain. Garnett quietly resigned, citing health reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOW&quot;/&gt;

In November 1804 Davy became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], over which he would later preside. He was one of the founding members of the [[Geological Society]] in 1807&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/society/history History of the Geological Society], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1810 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of new elements===
[[File:Sodium.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Sodium]] metal, about 10 g, under oil]]
[[File:VoltaBattery.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[voltaic pile]]]]
[[File:Magnesium crystals.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Magnesium]] metal crystals]]

Davy was a pioneer in the field of [[electrolysis]] using the [[voltaic pile]] to split common compounds and thus prepare many new elements. He went on to electrolyse molten salts and discovered several new metals, including [[sodium]] and [[potassium]], highly reactive elements known as the [[alkali metal]]s. Davy discovered potassium in 1807, deriving it from [[caustic potash]] (KOH). Before the 19th century, no distinction had been made between potassium and sodium. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Davy isolated sodium in the same year by passing an electric current through molten [[sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;/&gt;

===Discovery of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium===
During the first half of 1808, Davy conducted a series of further electrolysis experiments on alkaline earths including lime, magnesia, strontites and barytes. At the beginning of June, Davy received a letter from the Swedish chemist [[Berzelius]] claiming that he, in conjunction with Dr. Pontin, had successfully obtained amalgams of calcium and barium by electrolysing lime and barytes using a mercury cathode. Davy managed to successfully repeat these experiments almost immediately and expanded Berzelius' method to strontites and magnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electrochemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations in the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|pages=339–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that while these amalgams oxidated in only a few minutes when exposed to air they could be preserved for lengthy periods of time when submerged in [[naphtha]] before becoming covered with a white crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electro-Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations on the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 30 June 1808 Davy reported to the Royal Society that he had successfully isolated four new metals which he named [[barium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]] and magnium (later changed to [[magnesium]]) which were subsequently published in the ''Philosophical Transactions''. Although Davy conceded magnium was an &quot;undoubtedly objectionable&quot; name he argued the more appropriate name magnesium was already being applied to metallic manganese and wished to avoid creating an equivocal term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electro-chemical&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electro-chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations in the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The observations gathered from these experiments also led to Davy isolating [[boron]] in 1809.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenyon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=T.

===Discovery of chlorine===
[[Chlorine]] was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], who called it ''&quot;dephlogisticated marine acid&quot;'' (see [[phlogiston theory]]) and mistakenly thought it contained [[oxygen]]. Davy showed that the acid of Scheele's substance, called at the time [[Chlorine#History|oxymuriatic acid]], contained no [[oxygen]]. This discovery overturned [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] definition of acids as compounds of oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;/&gt; In 1810, chlorine was given its current name by Humphry Davy, who insisted that chlorine was in fact an [[Chemical element|element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davy |first= Humphry |title = On Some of the Combinations of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygene, and on the Chemical Relations of These Principles, to Inflammable Bodies |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 101|pages = 1–35|year = 1811|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1811.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name chlorine, chosen by Davy for &quot;one of [the substance's] obvious and characteristic properties - its colour&quot;, comes from the Greek χλωρος (chlōros), meaning green-yellow.

In 1812, Davy was knighted and gave up his lecturing position at the Royal Institution. He was given the title of Honorary Professor of Chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt; He gave a farewell lecture to the Institution, and married a wealthy widow, [[Jane Davy|Jane Apreece]]. (While Davy was generally acknowledged as being faithful to his wife, their relationship was stormy, and in later years he travelled to continental Europe alone.)

Davy then published his ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy, part 1, volume 1'', though other parts of this title were never completed. He made notes for a second edition, but it was never required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt; 
In October 1813, he and his wife, accompanied by [[Michael Faraday]] as his scientific assistant (and valet), travelled to France to collect a medal that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] had awarded Davy for his electro-chemical work. Faraday noted that 'Tis indeed a strange venture at this time, to trust ourselves in a foreign and hostile country, where so little regard is had to protestations of honour, that the slightest suspicion would be sufficient to separate us for ever from England, and perhaps from life'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=H.B.|title=The life and letters of Faraday, Vol. 1|date=1870|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davy's party sailed from Plymouth to Morlaix by [[cartel (ship)|cartel]], where they were searched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt;

Upon reaching Paris, Davy was a guest of honour at a meeting of the First Class of the [[Institut de France]] and met with [[André-Marie Ampère]] and other French chemists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt;

While in Paris, Davy attended lectures at the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], including those by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] on a mysterious substance isolated by [[Bernard Courtois]]. Davy wrote a paper for the Royal Society on the element, which is now called [[iodine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davy |first=H. |title=Sur la nouvelle substance découverte par M.

Davy's party did not meet Napoleon in person, but they did visit the Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] at the [[Château de Malmaison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt; The party left Paris in December 1813, travelling south to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, 1965&quot; &gt;For information on the continental tour of Davy and Faraday, see {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a series of experiments conducted with Faraday's assistance, Davy succeeded in using the sun's rays to ignite [[diamond]], proving it is composed of pure [[carbon]].

Davy's party continued to Rome, where he undertook experiments on iodine and chlorine and on the colours used in ancient paintings. This was the first chemical research on the pigments used by artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt;

He also visited [[Naples]] and [[Mount Vesuvius]], where he collected samples of crystals. By June 1814, they were in [[Milan]], where they met [[Alessandro Volta]], and then continued north to [[Geneva]]. They returned to Italy via [[Munich]] and [[Innsbruck]], and when their plans to travel to Greece and [[Istanbul]] were abandoned after Napoleon's escape from [[Elba]], they returned to England.

After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Davy wrote to [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] urging that the French be treated with severity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1992&quot;/&gt;
{{Cquote|My Lord,  I need not say to Your Lordship that the capitulation of Paris not a treaty;  lest everything belonging to the future state of that capital &amp; of France is open to discussion &amp; that France is a conquered country.

To take back from her by contributions the wealth she has acquired by them to suffer her to retain nothing that the republican or imperial armies have stolen:  This last duty is demanded no less by policy than justice.

===Davy lamp===
[[Image:Davy lamp.png|thumb|200px|upright|The Davy lamp]]

{{main article|Davy lamp}}
{{further|Arc lamp}}
After his return to England in 1815, Davy began experimenting with lamps that could be used safely in coal mines. The Revd Dr Robert Gray of [[Bishopwearmouth]] in Sunderland, founder of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coalmines, had written to Davy suggesting that he might use his 'extensive stores of chemical knowledge' to address the issue of mining explosions caused by [[firedamp]], or [[methane]] mixed with oxygen, which was often ignited by the open flames of the lamps then used by miners. Incidents such as the [[Felling mine disaster]] of 1812 near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], in which 92 men were killed, not only caused great loss of life among miners but also meant that their widows and children had to be supported by the public purse. The Revd Gray and a fellow clergyman also working in a north-east mining area, the Revd John Hodgson of [[Jarrow]], were keen that action should be taken to improve underground lighting and especially the lamps used by miners.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, David (1992). Humphry Davy: Science and Power. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 105-6. {{ISBN|0-631-16816-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy conceived of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamp's flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing out to the general atmosphere. Although the idea of the [[safety lamp]] had already been demonstrated by [[William Reid Clanny]] and by the then unknown (but later very famous) engineer [[George Stephenson]], Davy's use of [[wire gauze]] to prevent the spread of flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs. George Stephenson's lamp was very popular in the north-east coalfields, and used the same principle of preventing the flame reaching the general atmosphere, but by different means.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=364–373}} Unfortunately, although the new design of gauze lamp initially did seem to offer protection, it gave much less light, and quickly deteriorated in the wet conditions of most pits. Rusting of the gauze quickly made the lamp unsafe, and the number of deaths from firedamp explosions rose yet further.

There was some discussion as to whether Davy had discovered the principles behind his lamp without the help of the work of [[Smithson Tennant]], but it was generally agreed that the work of both men had been independent. Davy refused to patent the lamp, and its invention led to his being awarded the [[Rumford medal]] in 1816.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; &gt;[[David M. Knight|David Knight]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7314 &quot;Davy, Sir Humphry, baronet (1778–1829)&quot;] in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acid-base studies===
In 1815 Davy suggested that [[acid]]s were substances that contained replaceable [[hydrogen]]&amp;nbsp;ions;– hydrogen that could be partly or totally replaced by [[metals]]. When acids reacted with metals they formed [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s. [[Base (chemistry)|Base]]s were substances that reacted with acids to form salts and water. These definitions worked well for most of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;HSC, ''Conquering Chemistry'' Fourth Edition p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herculaneum papyri==
{{main|Herculaneum papyri}}

Humphry Davy experimented on fragments of the Herculaneum papyri before his departure to Naples in 1818. His early experiments showed hope of success. In his report to the Royal Society Davy writes that: 
'When a fragment of a brown MS. in which the layers were strongly adhered, was placed in an atmosphere of chlorine, there was an immediate action, the papyrus smoked and became yellow, and the letters appeared much more distinct; and by the application of heat the layers separated from each other, giving fumes of muriatic acid.'&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davy, 1821|Davy, 1821]], page 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Some Observations and Experiments on the Papyri Found in the Ruins of Herculaneum|journal=Philosophical Transactions|date=January 1821|volume=111|pages=191–208|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/107613?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|bibcode=1821RSPT..111..191D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the early trials prompted Davy to travel to Naples to conduct further research on the Herculaneum papyri. Accompanied by his wife, they set off on 26 May 1818 to stay in Flanders where Davy was invited to by the coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davy|first1=John|title=Memoirs of the life of sir Humphry Davy|date=1836|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman|location=London|page=97|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then traveled to Carniola (now Slovenia) which proved to become 'his favourite Alpine retreat' before finally arriving in Italy. In Italy, they befriended Lord Byron in Rome and then went on to travel to Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Humphry Davy: Science &amp; Power|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial experiments were again promising and his work resulted in 'partially unrolling 23 MSS., from which fragments of writing were obtained' &lt;ref name=&quot;Davy page 203&quot;&gt;[[#Davy, 1821|Davy, 1821]], page 203&lt;/ref&gt; but after returning to Naples on 1 December 1819 from a summer in the Alps, Davy complained that 'the Italians at the museum [were] no longer helpful but obstructive'.&lt;ref&gt;page 119 of Knight 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Davy decided to renounce further work on the papyri because 'the labour, in itself difficult and unpleasant, been made more so, by the conduct of the persons at the head of this department in the Museum'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy page 203&quot;/&gt;

==Work on the electrochemical protection of ships' copper bottoms==
From 1761 onwards, copper plating had been fitted to the undersides of [[Royal Navy]] ships, to protect the wood from attack by [[shipworms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Physis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=Frank A. J. L.|title=Davy in the Dockyard: Humphry Davy, the Royal Society and the Electro-chemical Protection of the Copper Sheeting of His Majesty's Ships in the mid 1820s|journal=Physis|date=1992|volume=29|pages=205–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the copper bottoms were gradually corroded by exposure to the salt water. Between 1820-25, Davy, assisted by [[Michael Faraday]], attempted to protect the copper by [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] means. He attached sacrificial pieces of [[zinc]] or [[iron]] to the copper, which provided [[cathodic protection]] to the host metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Humphry Davy: Science and Power|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered, however, that protected copper became foul quickly, i.e. pieces of weed and/or marine creatures became attached to the hull, which had a detrimental effect on the handling of the ship. The [[Navy Board]] approached Davy in 1822, asking for help. Davy conducted a number of tests in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], which led to the Navy Board adopting the use of Davy's &quot;protectors&quot;. By 1824, it had become apparent that fouling of the copper bottoms was still occurring on the majority of protected ships. By the end of 1825, the [[Admiralty]] ordered the Navy Board to cease fitting the protectors to sea-going ships, and to remove those that had already been fitted. Davy's scheme was seen as a public failure, despite the fact that, as Frank A. J. L. James comments, &quot;The somewhat ironical problem [...] was not that they were unsuccessful. They did after all preserve the copper as Davy said they would. The problem was that the protectors, on most ships, had a chemical side effect which provided nutrients for weeds, barnacles etc. thus fouling the ships&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physis&quot; /&gt;

==President of the Royal Society==
Elections took place on St Andrew's Day and Davy was elected on 30 November 1820. Although he was unopposed, other candidates had received initial backing. These candidates embodied the factional difficulties that beset Davy's presidency and which eventually defeated him.

The Society was in transition from a club for gentlemen interested in natural philosophy, connected with the political and social elite, to an academy representing increasingly specialised sciences. The previous president, [[Joseph Banks]], had held the post for over 40 years and had presided autocratically over what David Miller calls the &quot;Banksian Learned Empire&quot;, in which natural history was prominent.&lt;ref&gt;David Philip Miller, &quot;Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London&quot;, ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 1-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks had groomed the engineer, author and politician [[Davies Gilbert]] to succeed him and preserve the status quo, but Gilbert declined to stand. Fellows who thought royal patronage was important proposed Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (later [[Leopold I of Belgium]]), who also withdrew, as did the Whig [[Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset]]. Davy was the outstanding scientist but some fellows did not approve of his popularising work at the Royal Institution.

The strongest alternative had been [[William Hyde Wollaston]], who was supported by the &quot;Cambridge Network&quot; of outstanding mathematicians such as [[Charles Babbage]] and [[John Herschel]], who tried to block Davy. They were aware that Davy supported some modernisation, but thought that he would not sufficiently encourage aspiring young mathematicians, astronomers and geologists, who were beginning to form specialist societies. Davy was only 41, and reformers were fearful of another long presidency.

In his early years Davy was optimistic about reconciling the reformers and the Banksians. In his first speech as president he declared:

I trust that, with these new societies, we shall always preserve the most amicable relations... I am sure there is no desire in [the Royal Society] to exert anything like patriarchal authority in relation to these institutions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in David Philip Miller, &quot;Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London&quot;, ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davy spent much time juggling the factions but, as his reputation declined in the light of failures such as his research into copper-bottomed ships, he lost popularity and authority. This was compounded by a number of political errors. In 1825 his promotion of the new Zoological Society courted the landed gentry and alienated expert zoologists. He offended the mathematicians and reformers by failing to ensure that Babbage received one of the new Royal Medals (a project of his) or the vacant secretaryship of the Society in 1826. In November 1826 the mathematician Edward Ryan recorded that:

The Society, every member almost... are in the greatest rage at the President's proceedings and nothing is now talked of but removing him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in David Philip Miller, &quot;Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London&quot;, ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event he was again re-elected unopposed, but he was now visibly unwell. In January 1827 he set off to Italy for reasons of his health. It did not improve and, as the 1827 election loomed, it was clear that he would not stand again. He was succeeded by [[Davies Gilbert]].

==Last years and death==
[[Image:M Faraday Th Phillips oil 1842.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|left|Michael Faraday, portrait by [[Thomas Phillips]] c. 1841–1842&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?mkey=mw02170 National Portrait gallery NPG 269]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In January 1819, Davy was awarded a [[baronet]]cy. Although [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (also later made a peer&lt;ref&gt;As Baron Verulam and later Viscount St Alban.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] had already been [[knight]]ed, this was, at the time, the first such honour ever conferred on a man of science in Britain. This was followed a year later with the Presidency of the [[Royal Society]].

Davy's laboratory assistant, [[Michael Faraday]], went on to enhance Davy's work and would become the more famous and influential scientist. Davy is supposed to have even claimed Faraday as his greatest discovery. Davy later accused Faraday of [[plagiarism]], however, causing Faraday (the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]]) to cease all research in [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetism]] until his mentor's death.

Of a sanguine, somewhat irritable temperament, Davy displayed characteristic enthusiasm and energy in all his pursuits. As is shown by his verses and sometimes by his prose, his mind was highly imaginative; the poet Coleridge declared that if he &quot;had not been the first chemist, he would have been the first poet of his age&quot;, and Southey said that &quot;he had all the elements of a poet; he only wanted the art.&quot; In spite of his ungainly exterior and peculiar manner, his happy gifts of exposition and illustration won him extraordinary popularity as a lecturer, his experiments were ingenious and rapidly performed, and Coleridge went to hear him &quot;to increase his stock of metaphors.&quot; The dominating ambition of his life was to achieve fame, but though that sometimes betrayed him into petty jealousy, it did not leave him insensible to the claims on his knowledge of the &quot;cause of humanity&quot;, to use a phrase often employed by him in connection with his invention of the miners' lamp. Of the smaller observances of etiquette he was careless, and his frankness of disposition sometimes exposed him to annoyances which he might have avoided by the exercise of ordinary tact.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Davy, Sir Humphry|volume=7|pages=871-873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one of Davy's biographers, [[June Z. Fullmer]], he was a [[Deism|deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fullmer |first=June Z. |title=Young Humphry Davy: The Making of an Experimental Chemist, Volume 237|year=2000|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=9780871692375|authorlink = June Zimmerman Fullmer|page=158|quote=In prominent alliance with his concept, Davy celebrated a natural-philosophic deism, for which his critics did not attack him, nor, indeed, did they bother to mention it. Davy never appeared perturbed by critical attacks on his &quot;materialism&quot; because he was well aware that his deism and his materialism went hand in hand; moreover, deism appeared to be the abiding faith of all around him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:davygrave.jpg|thumb|right|Davy's grave at [[Cimetière des Rois|Cimetière Plainpalais]] in Geneva]]
He spent the last months of his life writing ''Consolations in Travel'', an immensely popular, somewhat freeform compendium of poetry, thoughts on science and philosophy. Published posthumously, the work became a staple of both scientific and family libraries for several decades afterward. Davy spent the winter in Rome, hunting in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]] on his fiftieth birthday. But on 20 February 1829 he had another stroke. After spending many months attempting to recuperate, Davy died in a hotel room in Geneva, Switzerland, on 29 May 1829.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

He had wished to be buried where he died, but had also wanted the burial delayed in case he was only [[coma]]tose. He refused to allow a post-mortem for similar reasons. But the laws of Geneva did not allow any delay and he was given a public funeral on the following Monday, in the [[Cimetière des Rois|Plainpalais Cemetery]], outside the city walls. Jane organised a memorial tablet for him, in [[Westminster Abbey]] shortly afterwards, at a cost of £142.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

'''Hecate''' or '''Hekate''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|ə|t|iː}}; [[ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἑκάτη ''Hekátē''}}) is a goddess in Ancient Greek [[Religion in Ancient Greece|religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], most often shown holding a pair of torches or a key&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles M 1986 pp. 307-318&quot;&gt;The Running Maiden from Eleusis and the Early Classical Image of Hekate by Charles M. Edwards in the American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 90, No. 3 (Jul., 1986), pp. 307–318&lt;/ref&gt; and in later periods depicted in triple form. She was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, light, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[witchcraft]], knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, [[necromancy]], and sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html |title=HECATE : Greek goddess of witchcraft, ghosts &amp; magic ; mythology ; pictures : HEKATE |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;d'Este, Sorita &amp; Rankine, David, Hekate Liminal Rites, Avalonia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She appears in the [[Homeric Hymn|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]] and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', where she is promoted strongly as a great goddess. The place of origin of her following is uncertain, but it is thought that she had popular followings in [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert&quot;/&gt; She was one of the main deities worshiped in Athenian households as a protective goddess and one who bestowed prosperity and daily blessings on the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/259138/Hecate|title=Hecate&amp;nbsp;– Greek goddess|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the post-Christian writings of the [[Chaldean Oracles]] (2nd–3rd century CE) she was regarded with (some) rulership over earth, sea, and sky, as well as a more universal role as Saviour (Soteira), Mother of Angels and the Cosmic [[Anima_mundi|World Soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1991/02.06.11.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 02.06.11 |publisher=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, Hekate Soteira, Scholars Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the nature of her cult, it has been remarked, &quot;she is more at home on the fringes than in the center of Greek polytheism. Intrinsically ambivalent and polymorphous, she straddles conventional boundaries and eludes definition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD671&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hornblower |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Spawforth |editor2-first=Antony |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |page=671 |isbn=0-19-866172-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and origin==
The etymology of the name ''Hecate'' (Ἑκάτη, ''Hekátē'') is not known. Suggested derivations include:
*From the Greek word for 'willing' (ἑκών).&lt;ref&gt;At least in the case of [[Hesiod]]'s use, see {{cite book |first=Jenny Strauss |last=Clay |title=Hesiod's Cosmos |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=135 |isbn=0-521-82392-7 }} Clay lists a number of researchers who have advanced some variant of the association between Hecate's name and will (e.g. Walcot (1958), Neitzel (1975), Derossi (1975)). The researcher is led to identify &quot;the name and function of Hecate as the one 'by whose will' prayers are accomplished and fulfilled.&quot; This interpretation also appears in Liddell-Scott, ''A Greek English Lexicon'', in the entry for Hecate, which is glossed as &quot;lit. 'she who works her will'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
*From Ἑκατός ''Hekatos'', an obscure epithet of [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD671&quot; /&gt; This has been translated as &quot;she that operates from afar&quot;, &quot;she that removes or drives off&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Anthon |title=A Classical Dictionary |location= |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |year=1869 |page=579 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the far reaching one&quot; or &quot;the far-darter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. E. |last=Wheelwright |title=Metaphor and Reality |year=1975 |location=Bloomington |publisher= |page=144 |isbn=0-253-20122-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejected a Greek etymology and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The name of the Egyptian goddess of childbirth, ''[[Heqet]]'', has been compared to ''Hecate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKechnie |first=Paul |first2=Philippe |last2=Guillaume |title=Ptolemy II Philadelphus and His World |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |year=2008 |page=133 |isbn=978-90-04-17089-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Early Modern English]], the name was also pronounced disyllabically (as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|ɪ|t}}) and sometimes spelled ''Hecat''. It remained common practice in English to pronounce her name in two syllables, even when spelled with final ''e'', well into the 19th century.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The spelling ''Hecat'' is due to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Arthur Golding |last=Golding |first=Arthur |year=1567 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asGFKAUTQC8C&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;pg=PA243&amp;f=false |title=Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book Seven }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this spelling without the final E later appears in plays of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]]-[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe, Christopher]] (first published 1604; performed earlier). ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vaNlzzIqXe0C&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Hecat#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Act III, Scene 2, line 21:] &quot;Pluto's blue fire and Hecat's tree&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare, William]] (c. 1594-96). ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey2gnY51jmoC&amp;;pg=PT195&amp;pg=PT195&amp;dq=%22By+the+triple+Hecat%27s+team%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22By%20the%20triple%20Hecat's%20team%22&amp;f=false Act V, Scene 1, line 384:] &quot;By the triple Hecat's team&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Shakespeare, William (c. 1603-07). ''[[Macbeth]]'', [http://www.playshakespeare.com/macbeth/scenes/257-act-iii-scene-5 Act III, Scene 5, line 1:] &quot;Why, how now, Hecat!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;[[Ben Jonson|Jonson, Ben]] (c. 1637, printed 1641). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8XcLAAAAIAAJ&amp;lg=PA144&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=%22our+dame+Hecat%22&amp;ei=yMfWSq_4AYqOywTtltiuDg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22our%20dame%20Hecat%22&amp;f=false ''The Sad Shepherd'', Act II, Scene 3, line 668:] &quot;our dame Hecat&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Webster's Dictionary]] of 1866 particularly credits the influence of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] for the then-predominant disyllabic pronunciation of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Noah |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmwIAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;pg=PT9#v=onepage&amp;dq=Hecate&amp;f=false |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |edition=10th |quote=Rules for pronouncing the vowels of Greek and Latin proper names&quot;, p.9: &quot;''Hecate''..., pronounced in three syllables when in Latin, and in the same number in the Greek word ''Ἑκάτη'', in English is universally contracted into two, by sinking the final ''e''. Shakespeare seems to have begun, as he has now confirmed, this pronunciation, by so adapting the word in Macbeth.... And the play-going world, who form no small portion of what is called the better sort of people, have followed the actors in this world, and the rest of the world have followed them. }}&lt;br /&gt;Cf. ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1894): [https://books.google.com/books?id=6aElzaWwzkQC&amp;dq=Hecate&amp;lpg=RA1-PA593&amp;pg=RA1-PA593#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false &quot;'''Hec'ate''' (3 syl. in Greek, 2 in Eng.)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate may have originated among the [[Carians]] of [[Anatolia]], where variants of her name are found as names given to children. Hecate was also worshipped in the ancient city of [[Colchis]]. William Berg observes, &quot;Since children are not called after spooks, it is safe to assume that Carian theophoric names involving ''hekat-'' refer to a major deity free from the dark and unsavoury ties to the underworld and to witchcraft associated with the Hecate of classical Athens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1974, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is some evidence that she might be derived from the local [[solar deity|sun goddesses]] (see also [[Arinna]]), based on similar attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Bachvarova, Hecate: An Anatolian Sun-Goddess of the Underworld, SSRN Electronic Journal · May 2010
DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.1608145&lt;/ref&gt; She also closely parallels the Roman goddess [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]], with whom she was identified in Rome.

Her most important sanctuary was [[Lagina]], a theocratic city-state in which the goddess was served by [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert&quot;/&gt; Lagina, where the famous temple of Hecate drew great festal assemblies every year, lay close to the originally [[Macedon]]ian [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] of [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratonikeia]], where she was the city's patroness.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 14.2.25; Kraus 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; In Thrace she played a role similar to that of lesser-[[Hermes]], namely a governess of [[Liminality|liminal]] regions (particularly gates) and the wilderness.

As Hecate Phosphorus (Venus) she is said to have lit the sky during the Siege of Philip II in 340, revealing the attack to its inhabitants.

==Representations==
{{Greek myth (earth)}}
[[File:AN00969955 001 l.jpg|thumb|Statuette of Triple-bodied Hekate. Pen, ink and light brown and grey wash.]]

The earliest Greek depictions of Hecate were not three-formed. Farnell states: &quot;The evidence of the monuments as to the character and significance of Hecate is almost as full as that of to express her manifold and mystic nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Lewis Richard Farnell, (1896). &quot;Hecate in Art&quot;, ''The Cults of the Greek States.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known monument is a small terracotta found in Athens, with a dedication to Hecate, in writing of the style of the 6th century. The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at [[Athens]] to be earlier than the Persian invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Hekate Kharites Glyptothek Munich 60.jpg|thumb|left|Triple Hecate and the [[Charites]], Attic, 3rd century BCE ([[Glyptothek]], Munich)]]

The 2nd-century travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] stated that Hecate was first depicted in triplicate by the sculptor [[Alkamenes]] in the Greek Classical period of the late 5th century BCE&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; which was placed before the temple of the Wingless Nike in Athens. Greek anthropomorphic conventions of art resisted representing her with three faces: a votive sculpture from Attica of the 3rd century BCE (''illustration, left''), shows three single images against a column; round the column of Hecate dance the [[Charites]]. Some classical portrayals show her as a triplicate goddess holding a torch, a key, serpents, daggers and numerous other items.&lt;ref&gt;Hekate Her Sacred Fires, ed. Sorita d'Este, Avalonia, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Depictions of both a single form Hekate and triple formed, as well as occasional four headed descriptions continued throughout her history.

In Egyptian-inspired Greek [[esotericism|esoteric writings]] connected with [[Hermes Trismegistus]], and in magical papyri of [[Late Antiquity]] she is described as having three heads: one dog, one [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], and one horse. In other representations her animal heads include those of a cow and a boar.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, Wendy Doniger,'' Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Hecate's triplicity is elsewhere expressed in a more Hellenic fashion in the vast frieze of the great [[Pergamon Altar]], now in Berlin, wherein she is shown with three bodies, taking part in the battle with the Titans. In the [[Argos|Argolid]], near the shrine of the [[Dioscuri]], Pausanias saw the temple of Hecate opposite the sanctuary of [[Eileithyia]]; He reported the image to be the work of [[Scopas]], stating further, &quot;This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hecate, were made respectively by [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polycleitus]] and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon.&quot; (''Description of Greece'' 2.22.7)

In the ''[[Argonautica]]'', a 3rd-century BCE [[Alexandria]]n epic based on early material,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The legend of the Argonauts is among the earliest known to the Greeks,&quot; observes Peter Green, ''The Argonautika'', 2007, Introduction, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason placates Hecate in a ritual prescribed by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight in a stream of flowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of an ewe, sacrificing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]]. He is told to sweeten the offering with a [[libation]] of [[honey]], then to retreat from the site without looking back, even if he hears the sound of footsteps or barking dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonios Rhodios (tr. Peter Green), ''The Argonautika'', University of California Press, 2007, p140&lt;/ref&gt; All these elements betoken the rites owed to a [[chthonic]] deity.

A 4th-century BCE marble relief from Crannon in Thessaly was dedicated by a race-horse owner.&lt;ref&gt;This statue is in the [[British Museum]], inventory number 816.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Hecate, with a hound beside her, placing a wreath on the head of a mare.  She is commonly attended by a dog or dogs, and the most common form of offering was to leave meat at a crossroads. Images of her attended by a dog&lt;ref&gt;[http://timerift.net/?p=21 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024203741/http://timerift.net/?p=21 |date=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are also found at times when she is shown as in her role as mother goddess with child, and when she is depicted alongside the god [[Hermes]] and the goddess [[Kybele]] in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eidola.eu/images/907 |title=Images |publisher=Eidola.eu |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Hecate has been characterized as a pre-Olympian [[chthonic]] goddess.

The first literature mentioning Hecate is the ''[[Theogony]]'' by [[Hesiod]]:
{{blockquote|text=And she conceived and bore Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos honored above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honor also in starry heaven, and is honored exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favor according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honor comes full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favorably, and she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:404-452 411–425].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Hesiod, she held sway over many things:
{{blockquote|text=Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will. She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will, she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then, albeit her mother's only child, she is honored amongst all the deathless gods. And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these are her honours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:404-452 429–452].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hesiod]] emphasizes that Hecate was an only child, the daughter of [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]] and [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], a star-goddess who was the sister of [[Leto]] (the mother of [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]]). Grandmother of the three cousins was [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] the ancient Titaness who personified the moon.

Hesiod's inclusion and praise of Hecate in the ''[[Theogony]]'' has been troublesome for scholars, in that he seems to hold her in high regard, while the testimony of other writers, and surviving evidence, suggests that this may have been the exception. One theory is that [[Hesiod]]'s original village had a substantial Hecate following and that his inclusion of her in the ''Theogony'' was a way of adding to her prestige by spreading word of her among his readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restless_Dead&quot;&gt;Johnston, Sarah Iles, (1991). ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece''. {{ISBN|0-520-21707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another theory is that Hekate was mainly a household god and humble household worship could have been more pervasive and yet not mentioned as much as temple worship.&lt;ref&gt;Household and Family Religion in Antiquity by John Bodel and Saul M. Olyan, page 221, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In Athens Hecate, along with Zeus, Hermes, Hestia, and Apollo, were very important in daily life as they were the main gods of the household.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labrys.gr/index.php?l=householdworship#1|title=Λ Α Β Ρ Υ Σ :: Λατρευτική κοινότητα Λάβρυς|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is clear that the special position given to Hecate by Zeus is upheld throughout her history by depictions found on coins depicting Hecate on the hand of Zeus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/baktria/kings/agathokles/t.html |title=Baktria, Kings, Agathokles, ancient coins index with thumbnails |publisher=WildWinds.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as highlighted in more recent research presented by d'Este and Rankine.&lt;ref&gt;d'Este &amp; Rankine, Hekate Liminal Rites, Avalonia, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate possibly originated among the [[Carians]] of [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert&quot;&gt;Walter Burkert, (1987) ''Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical'', p. 171. Oxford, Blackwell. {{ISBN|0-631-15624-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the region where most [[theophoric name]]s invoking Hecate, such as [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] or Hecatomnus, the father of [[Mausolus]], are attested,&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Kraus, ''Hekate: Studien zu Wesen u. Bilde der Göttin in Kleinasien u. Griechenland'' (Heidelberg) 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; and where Hecate remained a [[Magna Dea|Great Goddess]] into historical times, at her unrivalled&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1974, p. 128: Berg comments on Hecate's endorsement of Roman hegemony in her representation on the pediment at Lagina solemnising a pact between a warrior (Rome) and an [[Amazons|amazon]] (Asia)&lt;/ref&gt; cult site in [[Lagina]]. While many researchers favor the idea that she has Anatolian origins, it has been argued that &quot;Hecate must have been a Greek goddess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1974, p. 134. Berg's argument for a Greek origin rests on three main points: 1. Almost all archaeological and literary evidence for her cult comes from the Greek mainland, and especially from Attica—all of which dates earlier than the 2nd century BCE. 2. In Asia Minor only one monument can be associated with Hecate prior to the 2nd century BCE. 3. The supposed connection between Hecate and attested &quot;Carian theophoric names&quot; is not convincing, and instead suggests an aspect of the process of her Hellenization. He concludes, &quot;Arguments for Hecate's &quot;Anatolian&quot; origin are not in accord with evidence.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments to Hecate in [[Phrygia]] and Caria are numerous but of late date.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus 1960, p. 52; list pp.166ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AN01020070 001 l.jpg|thumb|Hecate by Richard Cosway]]

If Hecate's cult spread from Anatolia into Greece, it is possible it presented a conflict, as her role was already filled by other more prominent deities in the Greek pantheon, above all by [[Artemis]] and [[Selene]]. This line of reasoning lies behind the widely accepted hypothesis that she was a foreign deity who was incorporated into the Greek pantheon. Other than in the ''Theogony'', the Greek sources do not offer a consistent story of her parentage, or of her relations in the Greek pantheon: sometimes Hecate is related as a Titaness, and a mighty helper and protector of humans. Her continued presence was explained by asserting that, because she was the only Titan who aided Zeus in the [[Titanomachy|battle of gods and Titans]], she was not banished into the underworld realms after their defeat by the Olympians.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

One surviving group of stories suggests how Hecate might have come to be incorporated into the Greek pantheon without affecting the privileged position of Artemis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restless_Dead&quot;/&gt; Here, Hecate is a mortal priestess often associated with [[Iphigeneia]]. She scorns and insults Artemis, who in retribution eventually brings about the mortal's suicide. There was an area sacred to Hecate in the precincts of the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], where the priests, ''megabyzi'', officiated.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'', 14.1.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate also came to be associated with ghosts, infernal spirits, the dead and sorcery. Shrines to Hecate were placed at doorways to both homes and cities with the belief that it would protect from restless dead and other spirits. Likewise, shrines to Hecate at three way crossroads were created where food offerings were left at the new moon to protect those who did so from spirits and other evils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/HekateCult.html |title=CULT OF HEKATE : Ancient Greek religion |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval commentator has suggested a link connecting the word &quot;jinx&quot; with Hecate: &quot;The Byzantine polymath [[Michael Psellus]] [...] speaks of a bullroarer, consisting of a golden sphere, decorated throughout with symbols and whirled on an oxhide thong. He adds that such an instrument is called a ''iunx'' (hence &quot;jinx&quot;), but as for the significance says only that it is ineffable and that the ritual is sacred to Hecate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic saints: the Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 100; Writing at some length about the ancient greek 'iunx' [[Marcel Detienne]] never mentions any connection to Hecate, see Detienne M, ''The Gardens of Adonis'', Princeton UP, 1994, pp.83-9..&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate is the primary feminine figure in the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]'' (2nd-3rd century CE),&lt;ref&gt;The ''Chaldean Oracles'' is a collection of literature that date from somewhere between the 2nd century and the late 3rd century, the recording of which is traditionally attributed to Julian the Chaldaean or his son, Julian the Theurgist. The material seems to have provided background and explanation related to the meaning of these pronouncements, and appear to have been related to the practice of theurgy, pagan magic that later became closely associated with Neoplatonism, see{{cite book |editor1-last=Hornblower |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Spawforth |editor2-first=Antony |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |page=316 |isbn=0-19-866172-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she is associated in fragment 194 with a ''strophalos'' (usually translated as a spinning top, or wheel, used in magic) &quot;Labour thou around the Strophalos of Hecate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;English translation used here from: William Wynn Wescott (tr.), ''The Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster'', 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to refer to a variant of the device mentioned by Psellus.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A top of Hekate is a golden sphere enclosing a lapis lazuli in its middle that is twisted through a cow-hide leather thong and having engraved letters all over it. [Diviners] spin this sphere and make invocations. Such things they call charms, whether it is the matter of a spherical object, or a triangular one, or some other shape. While spinning them, they call out unintelligible or beast-like sounds, laughing and flailing at the air. [Hekate] teaches the ''taketes'' to operate, that is the movement of the top, as if it had an ineffable power. It is called the top of Hekate because it is dedicated to her. In her right hand she held the source of the virtues. But it is all nonsense.&quot; As quoted in Frank R. Trombley, ''Hellenic Religion and Christianization, C. 370-529'', Brill, 1993, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations in interpretations of Hecate's role or roles can be traced in 5th-century Athens. In two fragments of [[Aeschylus]] she appears as a great goddess. In [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] she is characterized as the mistress of witchcraft and the [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]].

In the [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] to [[Demeter]], Hecate is called the &quot;tender-hearted&quot;, a [[euphemism]] perhaps intended to emphasize her concern with the disappearance of [[Persephone]], when she assisted [[Demeter]] with her search for Persephone following her abduction by Hades, suggesting that Demeter should speak to the god of the sun, [[Helios]].  Subsequently she became Persephone's companion on her yearly journey to and from the realms of Hades; serving as a [[psychopomp]]. Because of this association, Hecate was one of the chief goddesses of the Eleusinian Mysteries, alongside Demeter and Persephone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles M 1986 pp. 307-318&quot;/&gt;

The modern understanding of Hecate has been strongly influenced by syncretic [[Hellenistic]] interpretations. Many of the attributes she was assigned in this period appear to have an older basis. For example, in the magical papyri of Ptolemaic Egypt, she is called the 'she-dog' or 'bitch', and her presence is signified by the barking of dogs.  In late imagery she also has two ghostly dogs as servants by her side. However, her association with dogs predates the conquests of Alexander the Great and the emergence of the Hellenistic world. When Philip II laid siege to [[Byzantium]] she had already been associated with dogs for some time; the light in the sky and the barking of dogs that warned the citizens of a night time attack, saving the city, were attributed to ''Hecate Lampadephoros'' (the tale is preserved in the [[Suda]]). In gratitude the Byzantines erected a statue in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 340 B.C., however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age, Philip of Macedon. In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger. To commemorate this timely phenomenon, which was attributed to Hecate, they erected a public statue to that goddess [...]&quot; William Gordon Holmes, ''The Age of Justinian and Theodora'', 2003, pp. 5-6; &quot;If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was Hecate. Hecate had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of &quot;liminal places&quot;, in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate's importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions. Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history. A statue known as the 'Lampadephoros' was erected on the hill above the Bosphorous to commemorate Hecate's defensive aid.&quot; Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, pp. 126-127; this story apparently survived in the works Hesychius of Miletus, who in all probability lived in the time of Justinian. His works survive only in fragments preserved in Photius and the ''[[Suda]]'', a Byzantine lexicon of the 10th century CE. The tale is also related by Stephanus of Byzantium and Eustathius.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a virgin goddess, she remained unmarried and had no regular consort, though some traditions named her as the mother of [[Scylla]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins'', Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers, 1974, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AN00866037 001 l.jpg|thumb|Triple Hecate]]

Hecate was generally represented as three-formed, which probably has some connection with the appearance of the full moon, half moon, and new moon.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Seemann (1884), ''The Mythology of Greece and Rome'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Triple Hecate was the goddess of the moon with three forms: Selene the Moon in heaven, Artemis the Huntress on earth, and Persephone the Destroyer in the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Harry E. Wedeck (1961 by Philosophical Library Inc), ''A Treasury of Witchcraft: A Source Book of Magic Arts'', p. 203 {{ISBN|0-8065-0038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara G. Walker]] (1983), ''The Women's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets'', p. 378 {{ISBN|0-06-250925-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Amelia Scull]] (1880), ''Greek Mythology Systematized'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Although associated with other moon goddesses such as Selene, she ruled over three kingdoms: the earth, the sea, and the sky. She had the power to create or hold back storms, which influenced her patronage of shepherds and sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hecate, Greek Goddess of the Crossroads|url=http://www.goddessgift.com/goddess-myths/greek_goddess_hecate.htm|work=Goddess Gift: Meet the Goddesses Here|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T16.5Hekate.jpg|thumb|right|A goddess, probably Hekate or else Artemis, is depicted with a bow, dog and twin torches.]]

Dogs were closely associated with Hecate in the Classical world. &quot;In art and in literature Hecate is constantly represented as dog-shaped or as accompanied by a dog. Her approach was heralded by the howling of a dog. The dog was Hecate's regular sacrificial animal, and was often eaten in solemn sacrament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Mildred Franklin, ''The Lupercalia'', Columbia University, 1921, p67&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of dogs to Hecate is attested for Thrace, Samothrace, Colophon, and Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD671&quot; /&gt;

It has been claimed that her association with dogs is &quot;suggestive of her connection with birth, for the dog was sacred to [[Eileithyia]], Genetyllis, and other birth goddesses. Although in later times Hecate's dog came to be thought of as a manifestation of restless souls or demons who accompanied her, its docile appearance and its accompaniment of a Hecate who looks completely friendly in many pieces of ancient art suggests that its original signification was positive and thus likelier to have arisen from the dog's connection with birth than the dog's underworld associations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead'', University of California Press, 1999, pp. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;  The association with dogs, particularly female dogs, could be explained by a metamorphosis myth.  The friendly looking female dog accompanying Hecate was originally the Trojan Queen Hekabe, who leapt into the sea after the fall of Troy and was transformed by Hecate into her familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LycophronAlexandra.html|title=LYCOPHRON, ALEXANDRA&amp;nbsp;– Theoi Classical Texts Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another metamorphosis myth explains why the polecat is also associated with Hecate.  From Antoninus Liberalis:
&quot;At Thebes Proitos had a daughter Galinthias. This maiden was playmate and companion of Alkmene, daughter of Elektryon. As the birth throes for Herakles were pressing on Alkmene, the Moirai (Fates) and Eileithyia (Birth-Goddess), as a favour to Hera, kept Alkmene in continuous birth pangs. They remained seated, each keeping their arms crossed. Galinthias, fearing that the pains of her labour would drive Alkmene mad, ran to the Moirai and Eleithyia and announced that by desire of Zeus a boy had been born to Alkmene and that their prerogatives had been abolished.

At all this, consternation of course overcame the Moirai and they immediately let go their arms. Alkmene’s pangs ceased at once and Herakles was born. The Moirai were aggrieved at this and took away the womanly parts of Galinthias since, being but a mortal, she had deceived the gods. They turned her into a deceitful weasel (or polecat), making her live in crannies and gave her a grotesque way of mating. She is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through the throat. Hekate felt sorry for this transformation of her appearance and appointed her a sacred servant of herself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 29, translation by Francis Celoria, Psychology Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Aelian told a different story of a woman transformed into a polecat:  &quot;&quot;I have heard that the polecat was once a human being. It has also reached my hearing that Gale was her name then; that she was a dealer in spells and a sorceress (Pharmakis); that she was extremely incontinent, and that she was afflicted with abnormal sexual desires. Nor has it escaped my notice that the anger of the goddess Hekate transformed it into this evil creature. May the goddess be gracious to me : fables and their telling I leave to others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;On the Characteristics of Animals by Aelian, translated by Alwyn Faber Scholfield, Harvard University Press, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Athenaeus]] (writing in the 1st or 2nd century BCE, and drawing on the etymological speculation of [[Apollodorus of Athens]]) notes that the [[red mullet]] is sacred to Hecate, &quot;on account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is ''trimorphos'', of a triple form&quot;. The Greek word for mullet was ''trigle'' and later ''trigla''. He goes on to quote a fragment of verse &quot;O mistress Hecate, Trioditis / With three forms and three faces / Propitiated with mullets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Duke Yonge, tr., ''The Learned Banqueters'', H.G. Bohn, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Greek concepts of pollution, Parker observes, &quot;The fish that was most commonly banned was the red mullet (''trigle''), which fits neatly into the pattern. It 'delighted in polluted things,' and 'would eat the corpse of a fish or a man'. Blood-coloured itself, it was sacred to the blood-eating goddess Hecate. It seems a symbolic summation of all the negative characteristics of the creatures of the deep.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parker, ''Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion'', Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 362-363.&lt;/ref&gt; At Athens, it is said there stood a statue of Hecate ''Triglathena'', to whom the red mullet was offered in sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin Leake, ''The Topography of Athens'', London, 1841, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; After mentioning that this fish was sacred to Hecate, Alan Davidson writes, &quot;Cicero, Horace, Juvenal, Martial, Pliny, Seneca and Suetonius have left abundant and interesting testimony to the red mullet fever which began to affect wealthy Romans during the last years of the Republic and really gripped them in the early Empire. The main symptoms were a preoccupation with size, the consequent rise to absurd heights of the prices of large specimens, a habit of keeping red mullet in captivity, and the enjoyment of the highly specialized aesthetic experience induced by watching the color of the dying fish change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davidson, ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Ten Speed Press, 2002, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[frog]], which was also the symbol of the similarly-named Egyptian goddess [[Heqet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armour |first=Robert A. |year=2001 |title=Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |isbn= |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also become sacred to Hecate in modern Pagan literature, possibly due in part to its ability to cross between two elements.&lt;ref&gt;Varner, Gary R. (2007). ''Creatures in the Mist: Little People, Wild Men and Spirit Beings Around the World: A Study in Comparative Mythology'', p. 135. New York: Algora Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87586-546-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her three-headed representations, discussed above, Hecate often has one or more animal heads, including cow, dog, boar, serpent and horse.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, Wendy Doniger, ''Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 195; &quot;Hecate&quot; article, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1823.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Hecate was closely associated with plant lore and the concoction of medicines and [[poison]]s. In particular she was thought to give instruction in these closely related arts. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], in the ''[[Argonautica]]'' mentions that [[Medea]] was taught by Hecate, &quot;I have mentioned to you before a certain young girl whom Hecate, daughter of Perses, has taught to work in drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Hunter, ''The Argonautica of Apollonius'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 142, citing Apollonius of Rhodes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess is described as wearing oak in fragments of [[Sophocles]]' lost play ''The Root Diggers'' (or ''The Root Cutters''), and an ancient commentary on Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica (3.1214) describes her as having a head surrounded by serpents, twining through branches of oak.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taxus baccata|yew]] in particular was sacred to Hecate.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Greeks held the yew to be sacred to Hecate... Her attendants draped wreathes of yew around the necks of black bulls which they slaughtered in her honor and yew boughs were burned on funeral pyres. The yew was associated with the alphabet and the scientific name for yew today, ''taxus'', was probably derived from the Greek word for yew, ''toxos'', which is hauntingly similar to ''toxon'', their word for bow and ''toxicon'', their word for poison. It is presumed that the latter were named after the tree because of its superiority for both bows and poison.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Suffness (Ed.), ''Taxol: Science and Applications'', CRC Press, 1995, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hecate was said to favor offerings of [[garlic]], which was closely associated with her cult.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Plants of Life, Plants of Death'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1998, p. 143; Fragkiska Megaloudi, ''Plants and Diet in Greece From Neolithic to Classic Periods'', Archaeopress, 2006, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also sometimes associated with [[Mediterranean Cypress|cypress]], a tree symbolic of death and the underworld, and hence sacred to a number of chthonic deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Freize | first = Henry | authorlink = |author2=Dennison, Walter | title = Virgil's Aeneid | publisher = American Book Company | year = 1902 | location = New York | pages = N111 | url = | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other plants (often poisonous, medicinal and/or psychoactive) are associated with Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hecate had a &quot;botanical garden&quot; on the island of Colchis where the following alkaloid plants were kept: Akoniton (''Aconitum napellus''), Diktamnon (''Dictamnus albus''), Mandragores (Mandragora officinarum), Mekon (''Papaver somniferum''), Melaina (''Claviceps pupurea''), Thryon (''Atropa belladona''), and ''Cochicum'' [...]&quot; Margaret F. Roberts, Michael Wink, ''Alkaloids: Biochemistry, Ecology, and Medicinal Applications'', Springer, 1998, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[aconitum|aconite]] (also called ''hecateis''),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, ''The Greek Myths'', Penguin Books, 1977, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], [[Origanum dictamnus|dittany]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]]. It has been suggested that the use of dogs for digging up mandrake is further corroboration of the association of this plant with Hecate; indeed, since at least as early as the 1st century CE, there are a number of attestations to the apparently widespread practice of using dogs to dig up plants associated with magic.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Plants of Life, Plants of Death'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1998, pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate was associated with borders, city walls, doorways, crossroads and, by extension, with realms outside or beyond the world of the living. She appears to have been particularly associated with being 'between' and hence is frequently characterized as a &quot;[[Liminal deity|liminal]]&quot; goddess. &quot;Hecate mediated between regimes—[[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] and [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]—but also between mortal and divine spheres.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie MacLachlan, Judith Fletcher, ''Virginity Revisited: Configurations of The Unpossessed Body'', University of Toronto Press, 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This liminal role is reflected in a number of her cult titles: ''[[Apotrope|Apotropaia]]'' (that turns away/protects); ''Enodia'' (on the way); ''Propulaia''/''Propylaia'' (before the gate); ''Triodia''/''Trioditis'' (who frequents [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]]); ''Klêidouchos'' (holding the keys), etc.

As a goddess expected to avert harmful or destructive spirits from the house or city over which she stood guard and to protect the individual as she or he passed through dangerous liminal places, Hecate would naturally become known as a goddess who could also ''refuse'' to avert the demons, or even drive them on against unfortunate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was probably her role as guardian of entrances that led to Hecate's identification by the mid fifth century with [[Enodia]], a [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] goddess. Enodia's very name (&quot;In-the-Road&quot;) suggests that she watched over entrances, for it expresses both the possibility that she stood on the main road into a city, keeping an eye on all who entered, and in the road in front of private houses, protecting their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This function would appear to have some relationship with the [[Iconography|iconographic]] association of Hecate with keys, and might also relate to her appearance with two torches, which when positioned on either side of a gate or door illuminated the immediate area and allowed visitors to be identified. &quot;In [[Byzantium]] small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate's importance to Byzantium was above all as a deity of protection. When [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress: The Virgin Mary And The Creation of Christian Constantinople'', Routledge, 1994, pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Hecate's close association with dogs derived in part from the use of watchdogs, who, particularly at night, raised an alarm when intruders approached. Watchdogs were used extensively by Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hornblower |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Spawforth |editor2-first=Antony |title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |page=490 |isbn=0-19-866172-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goddess of the crossroads===
Cult images and altars of Hecate in her triplicate or trimorphic form were placed at three-way [[Crossroads (road)|crossroads]] (though they also appeared before private homes and in front of city gates).&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD671&quot; /&gt; In this form she came to be known as the goddess [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]] (&quot;the three ways&quot;) in [[Roman mythology]]. In what appears to be a 7th-century indication of the survival of cult practices of this general sort, [[Saint Eligius]], in his ''Sermo'' warns the sick among his recently converted flock in Flanders against putting &quot;devilish charms at springs or trees or crossroads&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Porterfield, ''Healing in the history of Christianity'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Saint Ouen]] would urge them &quot;No Christian should make or render any devotion to the deities of the trivium, where three roads meet...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sto09001.htm Saint Ouen, ''Vita Eligii'' book II.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820234709/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sto09001.htm |date=20 August 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Hecate, &quot;[t]he dog is a creature of the threshold, the guardian of doors and portals, and so it is appropriately associated with the frontier between life and death, and with demons and ghosts which move across the frontier. The yawning gates of [[Hades]] were guarded by the monstrous watchdog [[Cerberus]], whose function was to prevent the living from entering the underworld, and the dead from leaving it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cavendish, ''The Powers of Evil in Western Religion, Magic and Folk Belief'', Routledge, 1975, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Hecate was worshipped by both the Greeks and the Romans who had their own festivals dedicated to her.

===The Deipnon===

The Athenian Greeks honored Hekate during the [[Deipnon]].  In Greek, deipnon means the evening meal, usually the largest meal of the day. Hekate's Deipnon is, at its most basic, a meal served to Hekate and the restless dead once a lunar month&lt;ref&gt;[5] The play Plutus by Aristophanes (388BCE), line 594 any translation will do or [[Benjamin Bickley Rogers]] is fine&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[new moon]].  The Deipnon is always followed the next day by the [[Noumenia]],&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 65, No.2, 1972 pages 291-297&lt;/ref&gt; when the first sliver of moon is visible, and then the Agathos Daimon the day after that.

The main purpose of the Deipnon was to honor Hekate and to placate the souls in her wake who “longed for vengeance.”&lt;ref&gt;These are the biaiothanatoi, aoroi and ataphoi (cf. Rohde, i. 264 f., and notes, 275-277, ii. 362, and note, 411-413, 424-425), whose enthumion, the quasi-technical word designating their longing for vengeance, was much dreaded. See Heckenbach, p. 2776 and references.&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary purpose was to purify the household and to atone for bad deeds a household member may have committed that offended Hekate, causing her to withhold her favor from them.  The Deipnon consists of three main parts: 1) the meal that was set out at a crossroads, usually in a shrine outside the entryway to the home&lt;ref&gt;Antiphanes, in Athenaeus, 313 B (2. 39 K), and 358 F; Melanthius, in Athenaeus, 325 B. Plato, Com. (i. 647. 19 K), Apollodorus, Melanthius, Hegesander, Chariclides (iii. 394 K), Antiphanes, in Athenaeus, 358 F; Aristophanes, Plutus, 596.&lt;/ref&gt; 2) an expiation sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Hekate's Suppers, by K. F. Smith. Chapter in the book The Goddess Hekate: Studies in Ancient Pagan and Christian Philosophy edited by Stephen Ronan.  Pages 57 to 64&lt;/ref&gt; and 3) purification of the household.&lt;ref&gt;Roscher, 1889; Heckenbach, 2781; Rohde, ii. 79, n. 1.
also Ammonius (p. 79, Valckenaer)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural parallels==
[[File:Houghton GC6 K6323 652o - Oedipus aegyptiacus, Isidis.jpg|left|thumb|Isis and her various other names and symbols from ''The Golden Ass''.]]

The figure of Hecate can often be associated with the figure of [[Isis]] in Egyptian myth. [[Lucius Apuleius]] (c. 123—170 CE) in his work ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' associates Hecate with Isis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I am she that is the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, Queen of heaven, the principal of the Gods celestial, the light of the goddesses: at my will the planets of the air, the wholesome winds of the Seas, and the silences of hell be disposed; my name, my divinity is adored throughout all the world in divers manners, in variable customs and in many names, [...] Some call me Juno, others Bellona of the Battles, and still others Hecate. Principally the Ethiopians which dwell in the Orient, and the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do call me Queen Isis. [...]”&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' 11.47.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[syncretism]] during [[Late Antiquity]] of Hellenistic and late Babylonian (&quot;[[Chaldean mythology|Chaldean]]&quot;) elements, Hecate was identified with [[Ereshkigal]], the underworld counterpart of [[Inanna]] in the Babylonian cosmography. In the Michigan magical papyrus (inv. 7), dated to the late 3rd or early 4th century CE, ''Hecate Ereschigal'' is invoked against fear of punishment in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Dieter Betz]], &quot;Fragments from a Catabasis Ritual in a Greek Magical Papyrus&quot;, ''History of Religions'' '''19''',4 (May 1980):287-295). The goddess appears as ''Hecate Ereschigal'' only in the heading: in the spell itself only ''Erschigal'' is called upon with protective magical words and gestures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before she became associated with Greek mythology, she had many similarities with [[Artemis]] (wilderness, and watching over wedding ceremonies)&lt;ref&gt;Heidel, William Arthur (1929). ''The Day of Yahweh: A Study of Sacred Days and Ritual Forms in the Ancient Near East'', p. 514. American Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs were sacred to Hecate and associated with roads, domestic spaces, purification, and spirits of the dead. They played a similar symbolic role in ancient China, where dogs were conceived as representative of the household sphere, and as protective spirits appropriate when transcending geographic and spatial boundaries. Dogs were also sacrificed to the road. As Roel Sterckx observes, &quot;The use of dog sacrifices at the gates and doors of the living and the dead as well as its use in travel sacrifices suggest that dogs were perceived as daemonic animals operating in the liminal or transitory realm between the domestic and the unknown, danger-stricken outside world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roel Sterckx, ''The Animal and The Daemon In Early China'', State University of New York Press, 2002, pp 232-233. Sterckx explicitly recognizes the similarities between these ancient Chinese views of dogs and those current in Greek and Roman antiquity, and goes on to note &quot;Dog sacrifice was also a common practice among the Greeks where the dog figured prominently as a guardian of the underworld.&quot; (Footnote 113, p318)&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be compared to Pausanias' report that in the Ionian city of Colophon in Asia Minor a sacrifice of a black female puppy was made to Hecate as &quot;the wayside goddess&quot;, and Plutarch's observation that in Boeotia dogs were killed in purificatory rites. Dogs, with puppies often mentioned, were offered to Hecate at crossroads, which were sacred to the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Eat Not This Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp 233-234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival in pre-modern folklore==
Strmiska notes that Hecate, conflated with the figure of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], appears in late antiquity and in the early medieval period as part of an &quot;emerging legend complex&quot; associated with gatherings of women, the moon, and witchcraft that eventually became established &quot;in the area of Northern Italy, southern Germany, and the western Balkans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Strmiska, ''Modern paganism in world cultures'', ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of the Roman origins of many European folk traditions related to Diana or Hecate was explicitly advanced at least as early as 1807&lt;ref&gt;Francis Douce, Illustrations of Shakspeare, and of Ancient Manners, 1807, p. 235-243.&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected in numerous etymological claims by lexicographers from the 17th to the 19th century, deriving &quot;hag&quot; and/or &quot;hex&quot; from Hecate by way of ''haegtesse'' (Anglo-Saxon) and ''hagazussa'' (Old High German).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Minsheu]] and [[William Somner]] (17th century), [[Edward Lye]] of Oxford (1694-1767), [[Johann Georg Wachter]], ''Glossarium Germanicum'' (1737), [[Walter Whiter]], ''Etymologicon Universale'' (1822)&lt;/ref&gt; Such derivations are today proposed only by a minority&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gerald Milnes, ''Signs, Cures, &amp; Witchery'', Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2007, p. 116; Samuel X. Radbill, &quot;The Role of Animals in Infant Feeding&quot;, in ''American Folk Medicine: A Symposium'' Ed. Wayland D. Hand. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; since being refuted by Grimm, who was skeptical of theories proposing non-Germanic origins for German folklore traditions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Many have been caught by the obvious resemblance of the Gr. ''Hecate'', but the letters agree to closely, contrary to the laws of change, and the Mid. Ages would surely have had an unaspirated Ecate handed down to them; no Ecate or Hecate appears in the M. Lat. or Romance writings in the sense of witch, and how should the word have spread through all German lands?&quot; Jacob Grimm, ''Teutonic Mythology'', 1835, (English translation 1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[etymology]] reconstructs Proto-Germanic ''*hagatusjon-'' from ''haegtesse'' and ''hagazussa'';&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot;&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hag Etymology Online], entry 'hag', accessed 8/23/09&lt;/ref&gt; the first element is probably cognate with ''hedge'', which derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *kagh- &quot;hedge, enclosure&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P, Adams, D.Q. ''The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World''. Oxford University Press, 2006. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; and the second perhaps from *dhewes- &quot;fly about, be smoke, vanish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot; /&gt;

==Modern expressions==
Hecate is now firmly established as a figure in [[Neopaganism]],&lt;ref&gt;For Hecate as a protector deity of a contemporary (mid-nineties) neopagan coven see: [[Sabina Magliocco]], ''Witching Culture: Folklore and Neopaganism in America'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p79&lt;/ref&gt; which draws heavily on folkloric traditions&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Neo-paganism/witchcraft is a spiritual orientation and a variety of ritual practices using reconstructed mythological structures and pre-Christian rites primarily from ancient European and Mediterranean sources. [...] most see in goddess worship a rediscovery of folk practices that persisted in rural Europe throughout the Christian era and up to recent times.&quot; Timothy Miller (Ed.), ''America's Alternative Religions'', State University of New York Press, 1995, p339; &quot;Neopaganism sees itself as a revival of ancient pre-Christian religion: the old nature religions of Greece and Rome, of the wandering Teutonic tribes and of others as well.&quot; Gaustad, Noll (Eds.),''A Documentary History of Religion In America Since 1877'', Eerdmans, 2003, p603; &quot;A second theme in the Neo-Pagan combination is the pre-Christian European folk religion or Paganism.&quot; James R. Lewis, ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft'', State University of New York Press, 1996, p303&lt;/ref&gt; associating Hecate with [[Wild Hunt|'The Wild Hunt']],&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of the wild hunt as a neopagan 'tradition' see the entry in James R. Lewis, ''Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions'', 1999, pp 303-304; For a 'moon magick' reference to Hecate as &quot;Lady of the Wild Hunt and witchcraft&quot; see: D. J. Conway, ''Moon Magick: Myth &amp; Magic, Crafts &amp; Recipes, Rituals &amp; Spells'', Llewellyn, 1995, p157&lt;/ref&gt; witches, hedges and 'hedge-riding',&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive discussion of the symbolism of the hedge and hedge-riding as it relates to contemporary witchcraft see: Eric De Vries, ''Hedge-Rider: Witches and the Underworld'', Pendraig Publishing, 2008, pp 10-23 (De Vries also mentions Hecate in this liminal context); and for the relation between hedges, hedge-riding and witches in German folklore see: C. R. Bilardi, ''The Red Church or The Art of Pennsylvania German Braucherei'', Pendraig Publishing, 2009, pp 127-129; As a general indicator of the currency of the association of hedge and witch see titles such as: Silver Ravenwolf, ''Hedge Witch: Spells, Crafts &amp; Rituals for Natural Magick'', Llewellyn, 2008 and Rae Beth, ''Hedge Witch: Guide To Solitary Witchcraft'', Hale, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and other themes that parallel, but are not explicitly attested in, Classical sources.

Hecate is worshiped by people who have reconstructed and revived the indigenous polytheist religion of Greece, [[Hellenismos]], such as groups like [[Hellenion (USA)|Hellenion]] (Hellenion is a 501c3 religious organization based in the USA dedicated to reviving the religions indigenous to Greece)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hellenion.org/|title=Hellenion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[YSEE]]. The Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes is an umbrella group based in Greece that is a legally recognized Non Profit Organization (NPO) and was &quot;founded in June of 1997 aiming to the morale and physical protection and restoration of the Polytheistic, Ethnic Hellenic religion, tradition and way of life in the &quot;modern&quot; Greek Society from which is oppressed due to its institutional intolerance and theocracy&quot;.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Hecate is mentioned in Act 2, Scene 1 of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth (play)|Macbeth]], in the title character's &quot;dagger&quot; [[soliloquy]]: &quot;Witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfs.sparknotes.com/macbeth/page_50.html|title=No Fear Shakespeare: Macbeth: Act 2, Scene 1, Page 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecate also appears as a main character in the British theater company [[Punchdrunk]]'s New York-based [[site-specific theatre]] work, [[Sleep No More (2011 play)|''Sleep No More'']], an adaptation of ''Macbeth''. The character functions as a villain of the work, silently conducting the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] who prophesy Macbeth's rise to power, and leading certain audience members into private interactions and stories in her small grotto. Many of Hecate's dominions are represented in various ways throughout the show, such as one of her familiars behaving in a dog-like manner around her; her grotto being connected to an herb-filled apothecary space; and watching from the shadows as the witches give their prophecies to Macbeth.

[[Catweazle]] often calls upon Hecate in the series of the same name.

Hecate is also one of the &quot;patron&quot; goddesses of many [[Wicca]]ns, who in some traditions identify her with the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess']] aspect of the &quot;[[Crone]]&quot;. In other circles Wiccan witches associate her with the &quot;Maiden&quot;, or the &quot;Mother&quot; aspects as well, for Hecate has three faces, or ''phases''.  Her role as a tripartite goddess, which many modern-day Wiccans associate with the concept of &quot;the Maiden, the Mother and the Crone&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite book |first=Donna |last=Wilshire |title=Virgin mother crone: myths and mysteries of the triple goddess |location=Rochester, VT |publisher=Inner Traditions International |year=1994 |page=213 |isbn=0-89281-494-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was made popular in modern times by writers such as Robert Graves in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and many others, such as the 20th century occultist and author, [[Aleister Crowley]]. Historical depictions and descriptions show her facing in three different directions, a clear and precise reference to the tripartite nature of this ancient Goddess; the later [[Greek Magical Papyri]] sometimes refer to her as also having the heads of animals, and this can be seen as a reference to her aspect of Motherhood; in this portrayal she is known as &quot;Mistress of Animals&quot;. Modern Hellenic polytheists honor Hecate during the [[Deipnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hellenionstemenos/Home/festivals/hekatesdeipnon|title=Hekate's Deipnon&amp;nbsp;– Temenos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Dr. Lewis Brown, an expert on religious cults, connected the 1920s [[Blackburn Cult]] (also known as, &quot;The Cult of the Great Eleven,&quot;) with Hecate worship rituals.  He noted that the cult regularly practiced dog sacrifice and had secretly buried the body of one of its &quot;queens&quot; with seven dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Weird Rituals Laid to Primitive Minds, Los Angeles Examiner, October 14, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Samuel Fort noted additional parallels, to include the cult’s focus on mystic and typically nocturnal rites, its female dominated membership, the sacrifice of other animals (to include horses and mules), a focus on the mystical properties of roads and portals, and an emphasis on death, healing, and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cult of the Great Eleven,&quot; Samuel Fort, 2014, 320 pages. ASIN B00OALI9O4&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate is also the namesake of the [[100 Hekate|hundredth numbered asteroid]], which was discovered by American astronomer [[James Craig Watson]] on July 11, 1868.  Its adopted name commemorates it as the hundredth asteroid, especially as 'hekaton' is Greek for 'hundred.' The name may also be explained as the derivation of the prefix [[hecto-]] commonly used in the metric system, or within the [[decimal]] system as three digits (e.g. as 100) therefore reflecting her later mythological trinary form.
